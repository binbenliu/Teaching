1,"b""apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer ( apart from swashbuckling braveheart ) . \ndirector ( and former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 . \nbeing the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet . \nperhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . . \nall of whom gave good performances in their respective roles . \napollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) . \njim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon . \nsuspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . . \nif they ever reach it . \ned harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly . \naudiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space . \nalso , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 . \nthe special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film-music maestro james horner . \nwatch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film . \na bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script . \nthose who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . \nthis is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film . \nyou should enjoy it . \n"""
0,"b'_dirty_work_ has a premise of deliciously mean-spirited potential . \nmitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( artie lange ) are losers in life : they were constantly picked on in school , and now they cannot hold regular jobs . \nbut as the trailer goes , "" there is one thing mitch weaver is good at--revenge . "" \nso he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc . \nthis should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy , but for a film called _dirty_work_ , what ensues is rather clean of spirit . \nin fact , what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine , but rather a more sappy reason : sam\'s father ( jack warden ) needs a heart transplant , and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list , his compulsively betting doctor ( chevy chase ) asks the guys for $50 , 000 to pay off his bookie . \nso for all the scheming that goes on , beneath every underhanded plot is--gasp ! --a \nheart , which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise . \nnot that there isn\'t a lot of nastiness on display--there is , but of a different sort . \nthere are frequent sexual references , most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam\'s impotent father\'s ongoing lust for them . \nand for a film rated pg-13 , director bob saget ( yes , that bob saget , of _full_house_ and _america\'s_funniest_home_videos_ fame ) and writers frank sebastiano , fred wolf , and macdonald himself , stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far--arguably a bit too much so ( was not one , but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary ? ) . \nbut the issue , of course , is not so much of taste as it is humor--as in , is it funny or not ? \nthe answer is a resounding no . \nit\'s not that macdonald isn\'t a funny guy . \nhe was one of the more consistently funny performers on _saturday_night_live_ before his much-talked-about firing , and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen ; it also doesn\'t hurt that he\'s a natural , likable screen presence . \nhe is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch , but , for the most part , the oneliners , as written , are flat , and the broad slapstick gags just don\'t work ( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings--a real riot ) . \nstill , macdonald\'s few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has . \nthe late chris farley , as hysterical as he ever was , is amusing in a cameo role , but , as a whole , the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance . \nsaget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman , adam sandler , and john goodman , but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _dirty_work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81-minute running time . \nthe film closes on a sad note of desperation , an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement . \ncome to think of it , i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _dirty_work_ . \n'"
1,"b'while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general . \nwords "" croatia "" and "" croatians "" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations . \nthe rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth\'s bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context . \nin a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers\' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise . \nsame line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime . \nthe movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe . \nhis latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro . \nshannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away . \nafter being arrested and tortured by kimba\'s secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely ) . \nupon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d\'etat against kimba . \nshannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war . \nthing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary . \nit shouldn\'t surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books . \nthose plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman\'s the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre . \nthis one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires . \nunlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work . \nthe movie doesn\'t try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda . \nchristopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role . \nhis performance in this film perhaps isn\'t breathtaking , yet adequate . \nhis notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the "" normal "" way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends . \nalthough the movie doesn\'t lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken\'s , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character . \nhowever , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o\'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon\'s reluctant colleague . \nthis was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director . \nwith the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess . \nluckily , the dogs of war had a good script . \nirvin\'s direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel . \nthe only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places . \nin the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes . \nunfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn\'t help . \nbut , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama . \n'"

0,"b'all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . \nultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996\'s other , underperforming disaster films ( dante\'s peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . \nbut , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . \nno number of name changes can help this picture . \nit\'s not just about a disaster , it is a disaster . \nhard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute . \nthe best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . \nthe community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies . \nfrom that moment on , it\'s all downhill . \nwhatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point . \nit takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured . \nbasically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs . \nthere\'s a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions . \nit\'s all very routine and uninteresting because there aren\'t any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense . \nthe film\'s conclusion is so preposterous that it\'s almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around . \naction films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion . \ngraham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle . \nunfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it . \nthe action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition . \nwe see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again . \nthe movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length . \nthe storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances . \nthere\'s tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash . \nhe and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv\'s "" lou grant "" ) , get stuck on a street that\'s rapidly turning into a river . \na group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers . \nafter charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs . \nas he swims and boats his way through huntingburg\'s roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives . \nthere isn\'t any real acting in this film . \nchristian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera . \ntom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen . \nrandy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing . \nmorgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script . \nfreeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time . \nfollowing in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn\'t trust nature\'s fury as the chief engine of conflict . \nas a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had . \ntitanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water . \nhard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible . \nthus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) . \nfortunately , there are only two elements left . \n'"

1,"b'making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed , especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece . \nwhen it comes to living up to expectations

greatest sequels ever produced . \n "" babe : pig in the city "" picks up precisely where "" babe "" left off . \nhaving won the sheep herding competition , farmer hoggett ( james cromwell ) and his pig are elevated to fame status . \na series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs . hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city . \nin doing so , the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original . \n "" babe : pig in the city "" flourishes where so many sequels fail . \nmost sequels simply rehash the events of the first film . \nnot "" babe : pig in the city "" . \nthis is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first . \nalso , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy . \nin essence , it doesn\'t attempt to copy itself . \ninstead , it strives to achieve an originality of its own . \nand it succeeds . \nthat\'s not to say the familiar is absent . \n "" babe : pig in the city "" retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film . \nalong with babe himself , ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride , as does mrs . hoggett ( one of this decade\'s best and most underappreciated comic characterizations , hilariously performed by magda szubanski ) . \nthe three singing mice also make the journey , chiming in with their cute high-pitched vocals . \nthe story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice . \nfrom there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne\'s soothingly deep narrative . \ncomposer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these . \nbut these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting . \nwhile staying at the flealands hotel , babe encounters a veritable ark-full of new animals . \nmonkeys , kittens , and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new "" urbanites "" that babe befriends , as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter . \neach character is distinctly unique , some of which are imbued with personal human-like struggles that are endearing and touching . \nand while this world focuses largely on these animals , we are introduced to two new human characters as well . \nmary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel , an animal-loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors . \nstein\'s landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature . \nwe also meet fugly floom , an old soft-spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel , utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions . \nnot having known who portrayed fugly

treat indeed to see one of cinema\'s legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance . \nthe greatest triumph of "" babe : pig in the city "" is the art direction . \nsimply put--it bleeds creativity , taking the look of the original film to a whole new level . \nrestricted primarily to a farm the first time around , this second installment creates an entire city , dazzling us with unique fable-like architecture . \nbut the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world\'s architectural landmarks . \ndesigning a skyline that includes the statue of liberty , the sydney opera house , the brooklyn bridge , the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower , ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities ( as seen in the film photo and pre-production drawing to your right ) . \nadded to that , many of this city\'s streets are the twin siblings of venice\'s gondola-trekked rivers . \nthe metropolis that has sprung from ford\'s vision is a wondrous sight to behold . \nit is a world that you want to walk around in . \nnorma moriceau\'s costume designs belong in this world , vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford\'s landscape . \nmost of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish , with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom\'s clown outfit . \nandrew lesnie\'s photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film\'s multiple emotional tones . \nmuch press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of "" babe : pig in the city "" . \nreports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg-13 rating . \nthese reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating . \nbut even so , to be anything harsher than the original\' s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms . \nby deleting a minimal number of shots , "" babe : pig in the city "" was eventually given the coveted g rating . \nalthough appeased , many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark , fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself . \nwell , to coin a phrase , the reports of "" babe : pig in the city "" \'s death at the hands of a dark , scary , felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated . \ngranted it has its moments of pseudo-morbidity , but all-in-all "" babe : pig in the city "" is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be . \nwhatever "" dark "" moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller ( the "" mad max "" trilogy , "" the witches of eastwick "" , "" lorenzo\'s oil "" ) . \nhaving served as a producer and co-writer on the first film , miller moves into the director\'s chair for this one , putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise . \nthe story of "" babe : pig in the city "" is an enchanting yarn , but one that doesn\'t achieve the emotional or character depth of the original . \nmissing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity , an individual\'s worth , challenging conformity , and one\'s purpose in life . \n "" babe "" dealt with this weighty subject matter , creating a timeless fable . \n "" babe : pig in the city "" should not have rehashed these themes , but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones . \nthis film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife , class differences , sacrificial courage , and so on . \nbut this film\'s goals aren\'t as lofty as the first\'s , instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach , allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting , sometimes intense , fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive . \n "" babe : pig in the city "" also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film , specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe . \nhoggett\'s love for babe , which grew ever so gently , is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality . \nbest exemplified in hoggett\'s dance for babe , this moving relationship was truly unique . \nit is something that i wish would have been present again ( and could have through fugly floom ) , but was not . \nplease understand , these are not negative criticisms , per se\' , but simply statements of what i see as the differences between "" babe : pig in the city "" being a very good film and the original being a

1,"b'james cmaeron\'s breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok . \nfor those of you who do not know the plot : in 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race . \nhuman survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed . \nhowever , some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor . \nto stop connor , the machines send a terminator ( arnold schwarzenegger ) back to 1984 to murder connor\'s mother , sara ( linda hamilton ) , and thus prevent connor from ever being born . \nin response , the humans send a protector , kyle reese , played by michael biehn . \nimages of machines and of humans\' reliance on machines dominate the film . \neven though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 , humans continue to use the machines . \nin the climax of star wars , luke relies on the force alone--his own spiritual power--to destroy the death star . \nin the terminator , however , sara must use another machine--a giant hydraulic press--to vanquish her enemy . \ncameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable--and he\'s not happy about it . \nunabated technological growth brings about the terminator\'s other obsession : the apocalypse . \nwe have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon : thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la . \nchildren watch the flames in a burning television . \nwhen the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him . \neven though the "" future is not set , "" there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie : the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence . \nall sara can do is await it . \n ( cameron doesn\'t wimp out like he does in terminator 2 ) \nthe end of the world is the human race\'s own fault , too . \nafter all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place . \nback in 1984 , when the cold war was still in full effect , the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war ( another obsession of cameron\'s ) . \nthese days , one can read a criticism of machine-like behavior in humans . \ntrue , humanizing touches are put into paul winfield\'s and lance henriksen\'s detective characters , but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected . \ncameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la . \nfrom a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done . \narnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist--unstoppable , merciless , obdurate . \nwe are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger\'s later works ( eg , commando ) , but fear him . \ncameron and hurd\'s script basically depicts a one hour and forty-five minute chase , taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot . \nwhile we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for , there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese\'s intentions . \ncameron directs the film at a rapid , kinetic pace . \neither the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving--usually both occurs . \nthe violence is not particularly graphic ( temple of doom\'s heart-pull scene outgrosses the terminator\'s ) , but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective . \nfor a low budget film , the terminator\'s special effects and art direction ( especially in 2029 la ) are remarkably well done . \nspecial mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton . \nit is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen . \none thing that doesn\'t hold up after all the years , however , is linda hamilton\'s hairdo . \n'"
0,"b'miramax "" disinvited "" on-line media from press screenings of scream 3 . \nthey ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler-filled reviews and post them prior to the film\'s february 4th release date-unsound reasoning . \nyou see , \'net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionals-miramax surely knows the difference between a member of the on-line film critics society ( ofcs ) and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain\'t it cool news . \nno , the ? mini major\' was afraid we\'d let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit , that scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved ( by this writer , at least ) franchise . \nsomething smells rotten in the state of california right from the get-go : cotton weary ( liev schrieber ) , the former lover and would-be killer of maureen prescott , sidney\'s mother , is juggling phone calls in his luxury car . \n ( once considered a danger to society , weary now hosts his own talk show , "" 100% cotton "" , a clever , if dated , jab at american pop culture . ) \nof course , a new ghostface dials him up , and , with memories of scream\'s unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind , we immediately wonder , where is the killer ? \nthe backseat ? \nthe next car ? \nthrilling prospects , to be sure , but actually , ghostface is at the weary residence , waiting for cotton\'s girlfriend ( kelly rutheford ) to finishing showering . \nwhat\'s missing from this sequence , and indeed scream 3\'s remaining frights ( most disappointingly , the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes , one of which might spring to life ) , is an elaborate and attenuated payoff . \nour other surviving regulars have become estranged . \nsidney ( campbell ) is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected locks , while dewey ( arquette ) acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2\'s movie-within-a-movie , "" stab 3 "" , and gale weathers ( cox arquette ) headlines a gossipy news program . \nmurder reunites them , as knife-wielding ghostface stalks the set of "" stab 3 "" , imitating its sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with sidney\'s death . \nthe appeal of ghostface\'s villainy is that he/she/they could be your boyfriend , your classmate , your next door neighbour . . . or a combination of people . \nscream was the first of its kind : a slasher mystery , with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next , but also who is/are the perpetrator ( s ) and what is/are his/her/their motive . \nironic self-reflection aside , parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because there\'s at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume . \nwith scream 3 , the novelty of ghostface\'s ever-mutating identity has worn off some , but the character remains conceptually potent . \nconceptually . the execution of ghostface\'s master plan this time around is creaky , because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we\'d come to understand in scream and scream 2 . the movie gets in the silly habit of saying "" all bets are off ! "" \nin reference to the "" rules "" of a trilogy\'s third act , but there\'s a difference between rule breaking and cheating . \nwith the departure of kevin williamson , who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3 ( that , for reasons incomprehensible to me , was ignored , save the notion of "" stab 3 "" ) , kruger needed to be reined in tighter , and by wes craven . \ncraven\'s direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects . \nhow else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo ( the slacker duo of kevin smith movies ) , akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny . \nit pains me to write this , but scream 3\'s comedy is generally laughless , with the exception of well-timed performances by josh pais ( as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in craven\'s music of the heart ) , jamie kennedy ( resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2 ) , and parker posey ( through sheer force of will as a b-actress ) . \nthe visuals are much weaker in part three , as well-the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming\'s camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before . \n ( aside : in the wake of columbine , craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3-why the sanctimony , when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves ? ) \nfinally , marco beltrami\'s music cues the suspense too blatantly-do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2 ? it\'s mostly silent . \nsting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere ; here , they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve-jangling score . \ni look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe , the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii-woefully out of synch with its prequels , scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish , and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs . \nthe film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t : ? part three must disappoint\' . \n'"

1,"b'on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo . \ntwo months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides . \nthis little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in "" lumumba . "" \npatrice lumumba\'s ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , "" lumumba - death of a prophet , "" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject . \npeck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader . \nwe watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men . \nimages of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . \njump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . \na third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader . \nhis small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville . \nat a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . \nas the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation\'s first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . \nthe coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country\'s vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . \nlumumba won\'t seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . \nhis initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . \nthe situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . \nthis tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . \npeck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50\'s and 60\'s . \n ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . \nsome colonial masters were better than others . ) \nthe effort involved in "" lumumba "" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . \nproduction values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . \nthe period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . \nthe screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman\'s work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba\'s life . \nthe political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . \nit concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn\'t embellish on a larger than life persona . \nthe family side of patrice\'s life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . \ni know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . \nthe story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . \nhigh marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . \nthe actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . \nin true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . \n "" lumumba "" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . \nit has more intelligence in its telling than anything i\'ve seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ . \n'"
1,"b""let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal . \nso i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal . \ni watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times . \nunder no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix . \nthis theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet . \nthe mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age . \nin other words , the sound sucked . \nas someone used to digital sound in a movie theater , bad sound doesn't do anything to add to a film . \ni'm not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together . \nthere , i've had my rant , now on with the regularly scheduled review . \nwhich sadly won't include commentary on the film's sound which i'm assuming was spectacular , but i'm just guessing . \nmy guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix . \nit is nothing short of stunning visually . \nsadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good . \nthe matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked . \nkeanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax . \nit turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster . \nnow machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator , plugged into a computer network . \nthe computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed . \nthe population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose . \nthat is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons . \nthey now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie . \nreeve's character , neo , is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . \nnewcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood's most underrated actors , joe pantoliano , join fishburne in the band of freedom-fighters . \nthe action sequences are nothing short of spectacular . \nthis can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's extensive pre-production training in martial arts . \nthis lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film . \nwhen you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful . \nas i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film . \nacting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn't real good either . \nkeanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances . \nalthough to his credit , it is one of his better performances . \nlaurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film . \nmore than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama . \njoe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had . \ncarrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role . \nit's nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks . \nyou have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film . \nit was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences . \ni also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue , which was terrible at times . \nin more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird . \nit almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie . \nso they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about . \nthereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability . \nmy other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending . \nthe setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before . \nthe ending itself was just plain strange

0,"b'since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993\'s steven spielberg drama "" schindler\'s list "" and directed 1993\'s intelligent "" searching for bobby fischer , "" his new film , "" a civil action , "" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career . \nwhat doesn\'t make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective . \nthe film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama . \nbased on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , "" a civil action "" is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children\'s death from leukemia due to unknown causes . \njan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families\' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city\'s drinking water . \nsuddenly , after hearing about the families\' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out . \nalso figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods\' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case . \ncoming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , "" a civil action "" is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience . \nperhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning . \nwatching the film , i couldn\'t help but notice its similarities with 1997\'s far , far superior film "" the sweet hereafter , "" which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children . \nin his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug-addict who has run away from home . \nnot only was the plotting similar to "" a civil action , "" but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes . \nconsidering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful "" a sweet hereafter "" was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm\'s character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl . \nin "" a civil action , "" however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness . \nwe do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters . \nthrough its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta\'s lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn\'t appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job . \nevery scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for . \nyou\'ve got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents\' plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what "" a civil action "" does . \nto be honest , i would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked . \naside from one flashback to when a man\'s young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering . \ni could say the performances were good , but who\'s fooling who ? \nsince every character is one-dimensionally written , no one\'s acting abilities are challenged in any way . \ntravolta plays a lawyer well enough , but that\'s about all he does . \nduvall virtually sleepwalks through his role , apparently only appearing to give one-liners at every chance he gets . \nand what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture\'s final scene , as a judge ? \nshe appears unbilled , since it is just a cameo , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place ? \nfinally , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role , the film left me with another question : what was the point ? \nabruptly ending without any susceptible momentum , where none came before that to begin with , "" a civil action "" seemed to me , at least , to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama , and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with . \n'"
1,"b'according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . \neven worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . \non the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . \nthis film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . \nthe film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . \ninstead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . \nalthough many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini\'s fascist regime . \namarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don\'t like federico fellini\'s work very much . \nevery member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . \ndistortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word "" amarcord "" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase "" i remember "" in local italian dialect . \nin the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . \nafter the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn\'t matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini\'s childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . \nfellini\'s views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . \neven the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . \ncharacters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta\'s sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . \nevery now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie\'s characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters\' visions . \nbecause of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . \neven the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini\'s totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . \nwhen fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . \nunlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn\'t care that much about politics . \nlack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini\'s humanistic approach to his characters . \neach of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . \nfellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . \nbecause of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . \nfellini couldn\'t produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . \nvignettes aren\'t memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character\'s fantasies . \nfellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside . \neven the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . \non the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . \nthis atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini\'s long-time associate nino rota . \nhis amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . \nthat music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art . \n'"
1,"b'star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) \nreview by matt pusateri \nfew movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas\' 1977 classic , star wars . \nthe original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture . \narguably , more americans today can explain what "" the force "" or a "" jedi "" is than a budget deficit or a serb . \nso 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? \ncan a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? \nagainst this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week . \nand despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment . \nwhile the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking . \nit is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films . \nthe phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films . \nas the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) . \nthe republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation . \nthe jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo\'s young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) . \nlater , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice . \non tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts . \nqui-gon senses the child is "" unusually strong "" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be "" the one "" prophesized to "" bring balance to the force . "" \nas anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader . \ncomplicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala . \nwhile amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul . \nif the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is . \nthe phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin\'s turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy . \nbut the complexity is not overwhelming . \nthe story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode . \none of the reasons the film\'s story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused . \nit\'s unclear whose story phantom menace is . \nin the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke\'s story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight . \nbut it\'s unclear whether this new film is anakin\'s story or obi-wan\'s . \nif this trilogy is centered on anakin , it\'s a shaky foundation . \nlloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive . \non screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is "" the one . "" \nthe rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas . \nneeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight . \nmcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility . \nportman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality . \nthe biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them . \nindividually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series . \nbut unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn\'t do as good of a job playing the characters off one another . \nin star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke . \nthe ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities . \nin the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other . \nthere is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other . \nindividually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them . \nthis is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers . \nbut despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging . \nmany of the wonderful elements of lucas\' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining . \nfirst , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates . \nthe characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing "" destroyers "" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council . \neach location is elaborate and complex . \nlucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines . \nmost of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren\'t possible when the films were made . \nmore than ever , in this new film , lucas\' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters . \nthe best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves . \nwatto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room . \nof all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable . \nspeaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks . \nwith more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas\' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy . \njar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon\'s accidental sidekick . \njar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble . \nthe animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors . \nhowever , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn\'t completely convincing . \nhe still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene . \nthroughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a "" roger rabbit "" -like presence . \nyou accept that he\'s there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character . \ninitially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film . \non my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn\'t mind him at all . \na second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates . \ndespite all the film\'s struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one\'s destiny and "" the force , "" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously . \nfortunately , lucas hasn\'t lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art . \nfrom the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film\'s thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t . \nin the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed . \nand finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action . \nfrom beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil . \nthe pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed . \nthe phantom menace won\'t win any major oscars . \nit probably won\'t beat titanic\'s box office record . \nand it\'s not even the best star wars film ( i\'d put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) . \nbut it\'s an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster . \nthe film can\'t live up to it\'s hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that . \nbut it\'s still worth seeing . . . \nprobably more than once . \n'"
0,"b'if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell\'s infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era\'s heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat . \nso when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) . \nmy , how easily does the worm turn . \nhype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics . \nat the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers\'s last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included . \nand with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . . \nboring . \nalthough christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_\'s lifelessness . \n_54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o\'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender . \nthese characters are about as generic as those descriptions . \nin focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat . \nwith the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers\' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club\'s famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow\'s feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she\'s a peripheral character at best ) . \nas such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ . \nwhat is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ? \neven whit stillman\'s _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn\'t so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . \ndancing isn\'t the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher\'s fault . \nfrom what i\'ve heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54\'s legend . \nbut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . \naside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane\'s fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . \nshane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . \nthis tacked-on "" romance "" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . \nthey fail on both counts . \nultimately , _54_\'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n . \nas in , there isn\'t any to be had for the audience . \ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . \nanyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . \nwhen anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn\'t get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film\'s conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) . \nstrangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . \nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them . \nthey\'re on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . \nthese two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there\'s still a great disco movie to be made . \nthe problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course . \n'"

1,"b'i know that "" funnest "" isn\'t a word . \n "" fun "" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . \nbut that\'s the word that came to me right after viewing "" chicken run .

"" \nso to hell with webster\'s -- "" chicken run "" is one of the funnest movies i\'ve seen in a while . \ni can\'t remember the last time i\'ve seen anything funner . \nthe chickens at tweedy\'s farm are up to something . \nliving in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . \none night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . \nrocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm\'s egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . \nshe orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , "" chickens go in ; pies come out . "" \nwhat sort of pies ? \nchicken pies , of course . \nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave . "" \nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \npart of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park\'s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \n "" the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run . "" \nthe plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \nthing is , the film doesn\'t feel like it\'s been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it\'s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \nbut they\'re * chickens * , so it\'s funny to us . \nanother thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park\'s films ) succeed is the animators\' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they\'re cribbing . \nthere are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17 . "" \nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom . "" \nthere\'s even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson\'s nationality and film history . \nthe "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution . \nconsider this : since july of last year , i\'ve seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \nwhy ? \nbecause once you got past the thought that "" they\'re parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch\' movie , "" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \nconversely , "" chicken run "" doesn\'t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \nif you\'ve never seen "" indiana jones , "" the chase sequence is still fun . \neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it\'s understood , and as a result , "" chicken run "" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \nenjoyment of this movie doesn\'t require knowledge of film history , but if you\'ve got it , "" chicken run "" is that much richer . \nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it\'s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on "" absolutely fabulous "" ) nails it . \nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \nthe characters\' inevitable romance doesn\'t feel contrived , but sweet . \npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn\'t any help . \njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that\'s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of "" chicken run , "" it comes as a delightful surprise . \nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \nthe animation is first-rate . \nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable "" chicken run "" really is . \nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios\' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \nas in such top-notch family fare as "" a bug\'s life "" or "" toy story 2 , "" "" chicken run "" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they\'ll catch all the details . \nanyway , the movie\'s just a boatload of fun . \nfunnest damn movie i\'ve seen all year . \n'"
1,"b'synopsis : captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600 , the ba\'ku , from the evil admiral dougherty and ru\'afro . \nthe enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba\'ku homeworld : lt . worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba\'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts . \ncomments : "" star trek : the next generation "" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to "" star trek , "" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s . \neven though it still enjoyed high ratings , "" star trek : the next generation "" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original "" star trek "" \'s cast in paramount\'s film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise . \nstar trek : insurrection is the ninth "" star trek "" movie and the third to focus on the "" star trek : the next generation "" crew . \nstar trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between "" okay "" and "" good . "" \nafter star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant "" star trek : voyager "" tv series , "" star trek "" fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise . \ni don\'t wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies . \nmost people reading this probably haven\'t followed "" star trek "" anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best . \nlet me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it\'s out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection\'s comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie . \nokay . let\'s move to the movie itself . \nstar trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity\'s exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners . \nthis combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy . \nmuch of this film appeals to trek fans\' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise\'s crew . \naudiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times . \nstar trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba\'ku homeworld . \nforget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show . \nthis tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba\'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son\'a . \nit seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state . \nthe enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data\'s actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son\'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba\'ku and plunder the planet\'s youth-restoring properties . \nsound pretty heavy ? \nit is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film\'s constant barrage of humor . \nwhen going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) . \nin a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba\'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at . \nthe acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good . \nsince they\'ve been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough . \nthe terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard\'s trademark , with his usual aplomb . \nbrent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) . \nthe supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good . \ndespite many other critics\' negative opinions , f . murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru\'afro well enough . \nru\'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune . \nlike the baron , ru\'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants . \nin one particularly memorable scene , ru\'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds . \nru\'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations . \n ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . ) \ndonna murphy must also be noted as a ba\'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with . \nmurphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance . \nthis is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with . \nin fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here . \na particular plot point involving anij\'s ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie . \nfor as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection\'s special effects were surprisingly disappointing . \nthey proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) . \nthe space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru\'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite . \nthe new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn\'t look quite right for a reason i cannot explain . \ndespite star trek : insurrection\'s frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film . \nit maintains roddenberry\'s largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , don\'t get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) . \ni\'d recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general . \nrated pg , i can\'t see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old . \n'"

\nin a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it . \nit's a story about a young man's coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring-do the likes of which haven't been seen on the silver screen in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world . \nit's high adventure , incredible special effects , and . . . well , it's just an _experience_ . \nsomething about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation . . . and \nit's about to do so again . \nthis new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film's devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now . \ninterviews , trailers , leaks from within lucasfilm . . . all of these have been collected , collated , and placed on webpages for people to see ( pages such as http : //www . islandnet . com/~corona/films/details/sw4 . html \nor , my personal favorite , http : //leopard . cs . latrobe . edu . au/~koukoula/ \n ) . \npictures of before and after have been placed side by side . . . even \nmonths before the movies were released , fans were making comparisons . \nin some cases , the changes were nothing less than phenomenal , and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater . \nthe digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here , unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original . \nfor instance , in my personal favorite example , the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep , moss-covered carvings and etchings . \nand mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling , booming city , with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing . \nall the starships and fighters are now computer-animated , getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made--and they look _fantastic_ . \nfour and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added , including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn't do it justice . \nhowever , much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself . \nthe negatives , badly damaged by the ravages of time , were brightened and returned to their original splendor . \nthe audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed , with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt , into glorious , booming , theater-shaking full-thx dolby digital stereo . \nand _that_ , more than the added scenes or new special effects , is where the real value of this new version lies . \nit's really true what they say in the commercials : star wars loses _so much_ on the small screen . \neven letterboxing doesn't make up for the decrease in size and definition . \nin regard to the star wars special edition , and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released , i'll make this final recommendation : go and see it . \ngo and see it more than once . . . it \nmay be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it's gone this time . \ntake along the youngsters who've never had the big-screen star wars experience--you'll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time . \nthere's magic in this movie--special edition or no , there can be no denying that it's still star wars , and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages , from four to four hundred . \nlet's all return to that time long ago , and that galaxy far , far away . . . \n"""
1,"b""near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king . \nthe following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia . \nat best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry . \nin 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different . \nthere have been a number of pushes on disney's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , a new champion has emerged . \ndreamworks' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed . \nthe other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively . \nalthough camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner . \nunfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition . \nin making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product . \nthe animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug's life , is the best-looking movie to date . \nthe animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with . \nthe key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot . \nnamely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d . \ndreamworks is the first studio to prove that they've got the stuff of success , and that they're capable of challenging disney . \nthe story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent . \nfor the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense . \nthe writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way . \nin fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything . \nmoses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family . \nmoses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves . \nby this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention . \nthe cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin . \nthe script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting . \nit's decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost . \nbut for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch . \n"""
0,"b""last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning . \nbased on the famous 60's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west . \nbut it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again . \nand co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects . \ni mean , what could possibly go wrong ? \nthe answer is just about everything . \nwild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate . \nthere are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression . \nbut the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it . \nat square one , we have a bizarre case of casting . \nwill smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series . \nmy guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved . \nsmith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him . \nhe's too much of a joker . \ni heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible . \nwhat makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office . \nthe plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists . \nthe trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent . \nloveless has taken the country's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns . \none such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right . \nthe visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings . \nunfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film's plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem . \nwild wild west is a running gag that never truly works . \nmost of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival . \nif it's one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it's the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered . \nkline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot . \nsalma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon . \nbranagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film . \nbut even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top . \nrarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is . \ni suppose there's always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint . \nwild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 . \nbut it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office . \nperhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith's name stamped on a summer movie . \nafter such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume . \n"""
1,"b'the event of events is upon us . \npeople have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . \ni don\'t think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . \nit is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . \nanyone who tells you "" it\'s just a movie "" is either lying or clueless . \nit is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic . \nthe second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated . \nbut that does not mean that the film itself is bad . \nin fact , it is terrific . \ni strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . \nit is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . \nthe film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo . \nthe republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as "" the force "" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate . \nunable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene . \non the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie\'s real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . \nhe is an innocent slave boy , but "" the force is strong with him "" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi . \nas any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker . \n>from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor\'s movie . \naround 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul . \ni think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this . \nthis is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks . \nhe\'s essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like "" exqueeze me ? "" \nand "" mesa go now , okeday ? "" , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying . \nthe visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph . \nif it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement . \nthe climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn\'t already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term "" popcorn movie "" . \nwhat made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams . \neven though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant . \nhis use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling . \nthe phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia . \nwhen you see "" a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away "" , when the familiar music plays , when the words "" star wars "" appear on screen , you\'ll feel a tingle even if you didn\'t see the movie when it first came out in \'77 . \nit feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side . \nit is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not . \nwe not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we\'re seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years . \nthe phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars . \nit works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n'"
0,"b""in 1970s , many european intellectuals , especially those on the left political hemisphere , became obsessed with the rise of fascism . \nwhich wasn't so hard to expect , because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies . \nin such times , when political involvement could be associated with noble passion , many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre-war europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany . \nof course , there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other , less noble reasons . \nfor them , moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era . \nwhich , naturally , made some of those films very popular among teen audience . \none of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass , who later made career shooting expensive , stylish soft porn . \nsalon kitty , his 1976 film , is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern , book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2 . \nin 1939 , walter schellenberg , one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite , exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats . \nnone of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents , and that all the rooms happened to be bugged . \nthe most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty , nominal madame of the brothel , didn't know the real purpose of that enterprise . \nscreenplay by tinto brass , of course , simplifies the story and changes few names . \nschellenberg is now wallenberg ( helmut berger ) , ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top . \nkitty kellerman ( ingrid thulin ) , apart from being madam , has a second job as a cabaret singer . \ncaught in the net of depravity is sweet , innocent girl margerithe ( theresa ann savoy ) thrown into brothel . \nthere she falls in love with customer hans reiter ( bekim fehmiu ) , disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe . \nwhen margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel , she finds out that the place is bugged . \nshe informs the madam of the real situation , and both women decide to confront wallenberg . \nthose who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film , that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation . \nbut , although salon kitty doesn't happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn ( although not very successful ; some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing ) , it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict - this time between power-hungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty . \nunfortunately , brass seems to overuse other cinematical references , probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino visconti's the damned , but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulin's unsuccessful attempt to imitate lisa minelli's musical numbers from cabaret . \nall in all , salon kitty is failure , although with some very interesting moments . \n"""

1,"b'review : ghost dog : the way of the samurai ( 1999 ) \ncast : forest whitaker , henry silva , cliff gorman , john tormey , gene riffini , victor argo , tricia vessey , isaach de bankole\' , camille winbush director : jim jarmusch writer : jim jarmusch \nrating : good shot ( stars ) \nlanguid , yet pointed and focused , ghost dog : the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek , ultra-cool , cinematic image of the hitman . \njuxtaposing the samurai\'s honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american/italian mafia , it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor\'s precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber , dinosaur-like , to function in the modern era . \ndirector jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast , ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit . \nusing a palate of bleached colors , jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film . \nhe doesn\'t cater to audience expectations of hyper-colorized , stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies . \nthe action is presented in flat , brutal codas . \nbullets have permanence . \ndeath has consequences . \nthe movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty . \nit is an anti-movie , of sorts . \nthere are few photogenic , empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with . \nthis isn\'t a film that lovingly holds your hand . \nthere are dark , contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder , just so , asserting itself for all to see . \nthe fulcrum for the movie\'s thematic balancing act is ghost dog , a mafia hitman . \na twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer , ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms . \nunlike the sleek , muscular killing machines one is accustomed to , we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly , replete with chapped , dirty hands and rumpled clothing . \nhe wears a hooded sweatshirt , which he often pulls over his head , giving him a monk-like appearance . \nthere are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal . \nhe uses old , worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical , efficient and pleasureless fashion . \nghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai , distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book , which he reads daily , hagakure : the way of the samurai . \nlife consists of simple pleasures for him : ice cream , warm rooftop naps and good books . \nghost dog lives , as it were , by the basic tenet expressed by his book ; one should start each day considering oneself as dead . \nliving atop an abandoned building , surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons , ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends . \nhe craves nothing more . \nas he puts it late in the film , "" i\'ve seen all i want to see . "" \nhe exists in a spiritual world of the mind , gaining moral sustenance from his readings . \nghost dog wasn\'t always as he is presented . \nin several roshomon-like flashbacks , it\'s shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan , that "" samaritan "" being a foot soldier in an aging crime family . \nghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man , louie ( tormey ) , as repayment . \nafter years of loyal service , ghost dog is sent , by louie , to kill "" handsome frank "" , a made man within louie\'s organization who has run away with the crime boss\'s daughter , louise ( vessey ) . \nghost dog wordlessly executes his task , witnessed by louise , whom he spares , as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon , clutching a copy of the book , roshomon . \nin a bit of synchronicity , louise loans the book to ghost dog . \nupset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family , the mob bosses , in turn , put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade . \nthe rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict . \nthe theme of old cartoons flares up time and again , each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog\'s world . \neach time a character is shown watching a cartoon , it\'s from the same era , betty boop , felix the cat , etc . , a reflection of days gone by . \nnear the end , louise is watching a cartoon that\'s a departure from the previously shown ones . \nit\'s a bit of audacity on jarmusch\'s part that is nicely effective , despite it\'s surrealistic nature . \nas ghost dog floats through his world , his life is touched by two people . \none is a sage little girl ( winbush ) who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading . \nshe comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities , just as louise ultimately does . \nby film\'s end , the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer . \nthe other person in ghost dog\'s world is an ice cream ( de bankole\' ) vendor who only speaks french , yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog . \nthe vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land . \njarmusch , through rapper/composer rza , underscores his film with rap and reggae music , which at first blush seems dichotomous , but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie . \nghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars . \n ( which , in and of itself , presents another paradox about ghost\'s dog\'s sense of honor . ) \nthe head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation . \nof all the cartoonish mobsters , he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world . \ngorman plays sonny , a lieutenant who respects the old ways , yet has a quirky affinity for rap music , a love comically shown in several impromptu displays . \nruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia . \nhe is a husk of a man , assisted by two hearing aids , who barks out advice without truly hearing what he , or others are saying . \nwhitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor\'s use , his face . \nghost dog is reticent to speak , often going for long periods without doing so . \nthe fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent . \nalthough the film has a deliberate pace , some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down . \ntruly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob . \nhe reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world . \ncarried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker , ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon , into a figure that garners sympathy , if not a bit of pity . \n'"
0,"b""the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes . \nalas , it refers to our heroes ! \nas it turns out , the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth ( via the mir space station ) thinks of the human race as a virus -- perhaps even a cancer -- that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further . \nafter all , we have taken up this entire planet , and if they let us live for another billion years or so , we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one . \nbut the human race doesn't have much to worry about . \nafter all , there's a woman named foster ( jamie lee curtis ) out there stopping the computer virus . \nshe's the chief navigator on a sea vessel ; travelling with her is captain everton ( donald sutherland ) , steve baker ( william baldwin ) , woods ( marshall bell ) , squeaky ( julio oscar mechoso ) , and richie ( sherman augustus ) . \nthey're all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous , abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters . \nlucky for us , we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board . \nthe evil captain everton thinks he's going to take the ship in and get a reward ; he convinces his crew that there's going to be big money , so they try to salvage the ship . \nsoon , however , when it's apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power , they realize that something bad must have happened . \nfinally , they meet nadia ( joanna pacula ) who explains their situation : a computer virus has taken over the ship ! \nit's creating bio-mechanical life-forms to eliminate the human race ! \nvirus is a truly dumb action thriller , one of negligible intelligence and innovation . \nwhen considering the entire film , you will realize that it lacks a single original scene . \nit's a direct rip-off of nearly every james cameron film ( aliens , the abyss , and the terminator films are the most plagiarized ) ; more importantly , it's basically the same movie as last year's deep rising . \ni liked deep rising simply because it's funny -- it knows it's silly and derivative . \nvirus takes itself seriously . \nand , in the most serious manner possible , it steals from every good and bad film of the genre , showing you countless familiar scenes , and sporting a cookie-cutter plot that any film of the sci-fi/horror genre could fit with a little trimming . \nbut what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out . \nokay , let me get this straight -- the alien race ( which is never really explained ) is basically sentient electricity . \nthey need to make themselves physical , so they use a space station to get onto a ship ( which is surrounded by water , but who cares about that ) . \non the ship , they make a bunch of clunky , immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people . \nafter that , they start using the dead people to create half-human , half-machine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around . \nthe leader , of course , is a big creature . \nevery film like this has a big creature at the end , but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around . \nvirus is indeed a cliched film , but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isn't very threatening . \nit's established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it , but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there . \non one level , virus is almost passable fun . \nit's really gory , and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal ( the director , john bruno , worked on a lot of cameron's films ) . \nthere's also a nice array of actors , even though none of them do any acting ( except for donald sutherland , who does a lot of very bad acting ) . \nthe bottom line , however , is this : virus is a bad movie . \nit rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing . \nin that order , i recommend that you rent any one of the alien films , simply to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes . \n"""
1,"b'bob the happy bastard\'s quickie review : \ni must admit , no doubt\'s single "" new "" is quite catchy . \nit was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon , the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back . \nthe result ? \na movie that\'s just as good as that song , really . \nit follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend . \nfirst we hear about a grocery bagger ( sara polley ) who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave ( with bad results , as a drug dealer feels he\'s been swindled by her ) ; then comes the story of an english grocery store worker ( same store ) who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends , where sex , gunplay , and stolen car trouble come into play ; then we see the story of two gay movie actors ( played by scott wolf and jay mohr ) who deal with a cop\'s strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl ( sara ) with their car ; and , finally , we come to another grocery worker ( katie holmes ) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer ( the one mentioned earlier ) . \nreally , it\'s all confusing to keep track of in review format , your best bet is to just , well , go . \nthe movie features some very good acting from all angles , and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product . \nthe dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized , not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending . \nthink of it as a , well , ending . \nthe intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie , as it\'s never really confusing and tells different sides of the story , like sliding doors kinda did . \nhowever , it\'s better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks , which sliding doors kinda isn\'t . \n'"
1,"b""it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast . \nsure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules . \nbut nothing entirely groundbreaking . \nwith the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques . \nit's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be . \nthe plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa . \nbut , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib . \nfound by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own . \nwe follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) . \nof course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero . \nin tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously . \ngags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here . \nmost of the characters are amusing without being forced . \nas tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture . \nhere , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle . \nof course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie . \nthe thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation . \ndirectors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel . \nas tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave . \nyour eyes can barely keep up ; it's a fantastic accomplishment . \nthe subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average . \nthere are important questions raised about tarzan's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters . \nthere is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i wasn't expecting to find here . \nsuffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained . \nthe grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk' from ghost . \ngoldwyn is effective playing someone who's not aware of his world's dangers . \nglenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child . \nas the movie's villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton . \nit helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods' hilarious hades from hercules . \na burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence . \nstill , this is one great thrill-ride that disney has constructed . \ni never expected rice burrough's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth . \nparents , along with all the kiddies , are going to find much to like in tarzan . \n"""
1,"b'in 1998 , director brett ratner and his stars , jackie chan and chris tucker , breathed new life into the buddy-action film genre with the cross-cultural "" rush hour "" - to the tune of about $250 million . \nyou don\'t mess with success , so the team is back again , and better , in "" rush hour 2 . "" \nthe combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non-stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in "" rush hour "" that played well to audiences around the world . \nthe formula worked so well , in fact , that the sequel was inevitable . \ni\'m never thrilled with the idea of a follow-up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations . \nsurprisingly , "" rush hour 2 "" wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it . \nthe script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no time getting to the point right from the start . \nterrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong , killing two american translators , and chief inspector lee ( jackie chan ) is handed the job of solving the crime . \nconcurrently , his friend james carter ( chris tucker ) arrives on the island for some much needed r&r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights . \ninstead , lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars . \nthe makers of "" rush hour 2 "" are working at a distinct advantage over the original . \nwe , the viewer , are familiar with the two lead characters and the already-existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around . \nthat chemistry was a high point ( and probably the saving point ) before and , now , the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit . \nlittle time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in "" rush hour . "" \nfirst and foremost to me , in "" rh2 , "" is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan\'s artistry in fight choreography . \nthe 47-year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and , here , he does not disappoint . \nchan\'s use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand , such as a trash bucket . \nhis moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding , on the tail end of a yacht , in a hong kong massage parlor and , for the finale , in a las vegas casino . \nlike harold lloyd or buster keaton , chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch . \nchris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop , carter , who teams , again , with lee to put down the bad guys . \nwhen he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case , he still looks to have some fun . \nwhen lee goes into a karaoke bar , the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan ( john lone ) and his hoods , carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff . \nthe comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and , with jackie chan , has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills . \nthe combo of chan\'s flying feet and fists with tucker\'s fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the "" lethal weapon "" films . \nthe supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently . \njohn lone , as ricky tan , is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign ( alan king in a walk through performance ) . \nlone doesn\'t chew scenery or make pronouncements to "" get lee and carter , "" but gives the chief bad guy elegance . \nzhang zi-yi ( "" crouching tiger , hidden dragon "" ) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky\'s taciturn henchlady , hu li , who carries on an ongoing battle with carter . \n ( carter has a problem , through most of the film , with hitting a woman , but this falls aside with their eventual one-on-one melee at the conclusion . ) \nroselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous ( and resembles sandra bullock ) as undercover agent isabella molina - she doesn\'t add much to the equation but is terrific to watch . \ndirector ratner and the original "" rush hour "" production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera . \ncinematographer matthew f . leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives "" rh2 "" the fluid camera movement the genre film needs . \nproduction design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look , whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino . \nthe rest of the techs are of the same high quality . \ni\'m surprised to even say that "" rush hour 2 "" is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies . \nit takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun , frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out , so far , this summer . \ni give it a b . \n'"
1,"b""i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan . \ni've seen some of his films ( silkwood , backdraft , unlawful entry ) and while he gave adequate performances , i have never been impressed with his work . \nbreakdown , then , is something of a surprise . \nrussell gives a fine performance , as do most of the cast , one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film . \nto say that he holds the film together would not be completely true , but he does it no harm . \nrussell plays jeff , one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy ( kathleen quinlan ) cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life . \nwhile journeying through the desert their car breaks down and , left helpless and stranded , jeff waves down a passing truck driver ( j . t . \nwalsh ) who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck . \nbecause of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians , jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help . \nthat , it seems , is the last time jeff ( or anyone else ) sees her . \nbreakdown has been compared to several movies : george sluizer's the vanishing ( the original , hopefully , not his appalling hollywood remake ) , steven spielberg's duel and any number of hitchcock films . \nas with these , breakdown does not , for the most part , stray down the conventional path of the american action-thriller . \njeff does not become a gun-toting vigilante on the hunt for his wife , but instead becomes a scared , confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on . \nwhen we do find out what has happened to amy , it does come as a slight disappointment , if only because it's too early in the film ; i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment , but this affects the film little . \nrussell , as mentioned earlier , is very good in his role , and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo 13 . \nj . t . \nwalsh , as the possibly evil truck driver , is terrific ; he is one of the best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood doesn't seem to know what to do with , but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here . \nthe reason he makes such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person , one anyone would be able to trust , which makes the plot that much more believable . \nbreakdown is what hollywood doesn't make enough of , a great thriller with believable characters and scenes that do , indeed , have viewers on the edge of their seats . \none of the most genuinely exciting films i've seen in a long time . \n"""

0,"b'let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official ( and even unofficial ) james bond series . \nit is so full of self-parody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching a spoof . \nan omen of what is to come is provided by the pre-credits sequence , a dull affair featuring a confrontation between a man ( it\'s difficult to give a better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie ) and the assassin of the title . \na song with woefully terrible lyrics follows , and the rest of the movie is even worse . \nthe plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual rule-the-world so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s , but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin , francisco scaramanga ( christopher lee , putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie ) who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moore\'s 007 . \nthere is also a flimsy connection with the energy crisis and a missing solar cell with 95% efficiency . \nit\'s as much of a mess as it sounds . \nbond is "" helped "" in his task by mary goodnight ( ekland ) , whose character couldn\'t possibly be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo . \nduring the course of the movie she gets locked in both a closet and a car trunk , blunders around a control room accidentally setting off a laser and serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever . \nmaud adams ( later to star in octopussy ) is a much more stronger and useful character , but she hardly features in the movie . \nscaramanga\'s lackey is a dwarf called nik-nak , who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series , serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures . \nworse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie . \nthere is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in ( not counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists -- another misguided attempt at humour ) . \nthe solitary car chase might have been a highlight , but the "" action "" is interrupted on a frequent basis by a redneck sheriff ( j . w . \npepper , played by clifton james of live and let die "" fame "" ) yelling stupid comments out of the passenger window . \nhe is easily the most irritating character in a james bond movie . \neven his presence could have been made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history , a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge -- could have been , except somebody got the idea to dub a mocking whistle tone over the final print . \non top of that debacle , the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramanga\'s "" funhouse "" . \nthe only good thing that came out of this movie was that the producers had to make the next film in the series ( the infinitely superior "" the spy who loved me "" ) a great film in order for the bond franchise to survive . \n'"
0,"b""girl 6 is , in a word , a mess . \ni was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film . \nthere was no sense of where the film was going , or any kind of coherent narrative . \nif there was a point to the film , i missed it . \ngirl 6 , by the way , is the way theresa randle's character is addressed in the phone sex workplace ; all the girls are known by their numbers . \nthe plot , such as it is : theresa randle is a struggling n . y . actress , and eventually takes a job as a phone-sex operator . \nshe begins to lose contact with reality , as her job consumes her . \nalso , she must deal with the advances of her ex-husband ( isiah washington ) . \nhe is an ex- con thief , and she tries to keep him away , while at the same time , it's clear that she still harbors feelings for him . \nher neighbor , jimmy ( spike lee ) functions as the observer ; mediating between the ex- husband and girl 6 . \nhe also functions as a point of stability , as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex . \nthe soundtrack , consisting of songs by prince , was jarring . \nit kept taking my attention from the film - not altogether a bad thing , i'll grant you , as what was transpiring onscreen wasn't that riveting . \nfor parts of the middle of the film , the music stayed blissfully in the background . \nin the opening sequence and one scene later in the film , however , the music was particularly loud and distracting . \nof course , i've never really cared for prince's ( or tafkap if you like ) music . \nprince fans might love the soundtrack , but it will probably be distracting , even to die-hard fans . \nof the performances , the only one that stood out was spike lee's buddy character , jimmy . \nhe was excellent as the always-broke neighbor of girl 6 . \nhe should have stuck to acting in this film . \nthere are several sequences that gave me the impression that he'd like to be oliver stone when he grows up . \nthere are scenes shot with different types of film , which are purposely grainy , and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stone's natural born killers . \nin that film , they worked to propel the narrative . \nin this film , they just made me more confused . \nthere are some amusing moments , and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phone-sex industry the multi-billion dollar industry that it has become . \nother than that , though , nothing much happens . \nthere are a few intense moments , as when one caller becomes frightening , but even that is rather lackluster . \ni'm not the biggest fan of spike lee , though i'd agree that he has done some very good work in the past . \nin girl 6 , though , he seems to be floundering . \nhe had an interesting idea , a fairly good setup , and seemed to wander aimlessly from there . \ngirl 6 earns a grade of d . \n"""

"" \nthis uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie ( 1976 ) , heathers ( 1989 ) and clueless ( 1995 ) and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich ? s . \nalong the way writer/director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own . \nthe film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo ( judy greer ) about the four most popular girls at reagan high : courtney shayne ( rose mcgowan ) who can basically be summed up as satan in heels , julie freeman ( rebecca gayheart ) a good girl with the face of a supermodel , marcie fox ( julie benz ) a dim-witted blonde who demands that people call her "" foxy "" , and liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) an angel in disguise . \nliz is everyone\'s favorite because she\'s both beautiful and kind . \nliz is about to turn 17 and , as a prank , courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning . \nin order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her . \nthey then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney\'s car but when they open it later , polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment , their lives will never be the same : poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat ( the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at liz\'s dead body ) . \ncourtney , thinking fast , decides to pass the death off as a rape/murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her . \nthings get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to . \nin order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into "" vylette "" , hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students . \nup until about this point the film is effective enough . \nhowever , an investigation begins into liz\'s death and the film becomes excessively dull . \nthe recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch . \ncourtney\'s plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson , in a brief cameo ) is never believable for a second . \nmeanwhile , the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot . \njulie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ ) . \nhe apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid . \nfern\'s rise to popularity is equally lame . \nwe do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality ) during this section . \nit\'s a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school\'s resident jock stud dane ( ethan erickson ) to demonstrate , using a popsicle , exactly what he would like for her to do to him . \nit at least provides us with a look at courtney\'s personality but the way the scene finishes doesn\'t make any sense . \nstein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting . \nwilliam katt and p . j . soles ( students in carrie ) are liz\'s distraught parents , jeff conaway ( from grease ( 1978 ) ) is julie\'s creepy single dad and carol kane ( the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls ( 1979 ) ) camps it up as principal miss sherman . \nat times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema\'s greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer . \nthe only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look . \nthe costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid . \nthey were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color . \ndirector of photography amy vicent , who beautifully lensed eve\'s bayou ( 1997 ) , does a remarkable job here as well . \nshot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive . \nperformances are mostly sub-par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments ( compared with her excellent work in the doom generation ( 1995 ) and scream ( 1996 ) ) and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty . \nnone of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actress/singer tatyana ali , who has a small role as a cheerleader . \nthe male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like "" auto stud , "" "" college stud , "" and "" high school stud #2 .

0,"b'this is your definitive "" hollywood "" movie , extremely predictable , following the basic formula ( a horrible ending ) , overzealous writing ( meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting , therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space ) and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wise-ass character ( of which we\'ve seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly , wasn\'t used enough here ) , i\'m afraid the film would have been completely unbearable . \nin this film , ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend . \nwhile in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her . \nover money ( how original ) . \nwhile in jail she works out , exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition . \nnow she has learned about a law titled "" double jeopardy "" stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her ( although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works ) . \nnow her po ( parole officer ) , and a bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims . \nskipping over to the acting : the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress ( no offense , she has been good [simon birch] and even very good to great [kiss the girls] at times , in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better . . . \nbut she\'s terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying ) doesn\'t really add to the movie at all ; just takes away . \nas i\'d said , jones was fine , although he did not have much to work with . \nhe was much more of a supporting character . \nwhich is fine , and he handled it well ; especially considering the material he had to work with . \ni feel this film had alot going for it . \noriginality not being an issue . \nthe acting was the only thing ( as i said ) keeping it alive . \nthe plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better . \nthe action scenes were well made ( however sometimes out of place ) . \ni was just left unsatisfied in the long run . \nso basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely over-thought , the plot has certainly been done before ( generally speaking ) , the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot , and is basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones , who if he had some more screentime , could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating ; in my book , anyway . \nkeep this in mind , if you\'re in the mood for a good action film -- rent the fugitive . \nd+ \n'"
0,"b'one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o\'donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton\'s 1925 silent film seven chances . \nnow i\'ve never seen seven chances , as i\'m more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this . \no\'donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company . \nhe also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he\'s unwilling to marry her . \nhis reasons ? \nwell he\'s a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently don\'t like to be roped or something ( hey , that\'s the movie\'s explanation . . . \ni\'d marry renee zellweger in a second ) . \neventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it\'s the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever . \nhe essentially says to her , "" you win "" and hands her a ring . \nthe audience should now hate this character . \ni did . \nthen the meat of the plot presents itself . \njimmie\'s grandfather ( peter ustinov , completely wasted ) dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business . \nhowever , in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers , jimmie must be married before his next birthday ( which is just over 24 hours away ) . \nhaving blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a "" business proposition "" . \nthe movie wasn\'t half bad by this time , surprisingly . \nit wasn\'t boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point . \nustinov\'s character left a video will , and while he\'s reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself "" what is this , brewster\'s millions ?

"" \nit was quite surreal . \nsomething happens though during the film\'s final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive . \nup to that point , all of jimmie\'s prior girlfriends had turned down his "" business proposition "" which i felt was good . \nat least the film wasn\'t painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers . \nwhen jimmie has no other options , his goofy friend ( played by artie lange , making a career out of playing the goofy friend ) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story . \nat this point , 100 , 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride . \nthese women arrive at jimmie\'s location and immediately start bullying him about what he\'s looking for in a woman . \nwhen he\'s had enough of their unjustified attacks , he tells the angry mob that there\'s been a mistake and he won\'t be marrying any of them . \nas a result , the women proceed to chase him around the city , in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off . \nthis goes on for the rest of the film . \nit\'s just chris o\'donnell running from 100 , 000 obnoxious , greedy , angry and stupid women . \nmy groans of disgust could be heard for miles . \nthe film finally ended ( thankfully ) , but to this day i\'m still groaning . \nthe bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video . \nit contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , cast and crew info , and special dvd-rom features . \nthe original theatrical trailer is also on the disc , which contains scenes not in the film . \napparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o\'donnell around the city , and at one point o\'donnell is leaping from the tops of buses . \nso that was bad enough to be cut , but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good ? \nugh . \n'"

1,"b'richard linklater\'s "" slacker , "" made in 1991 for a budget of only $23 , 000 , immerses itself in the twentysomething , college-town culture of austin , texas . \nmost of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning . \ntheir lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation ; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy , the pervasiveness of slave morality , the subtle messages in pop culture , and such . \nask them what they\'ve been doing lately , and they\'ll more likely than not reply , "" oh , you know , just hanging out . "" \nlinklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters : the camera follows one person for a few minutes , then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person , who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door . \n . \n . \n . \nit\'s certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk : some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas , some of them are just plain weird , and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are . \nthe opening monologue , delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver , tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film . \nother characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy , while groups of pseudo-intellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle bribery-based morality in "" scooby-doo . "" \nfor the most part , however , the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types . \nnear the beginning , a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks , warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars . \nanother man seems to be collecting televisions , keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown and destroying the camera . \nand in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film , a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below . \nthe only problem with "" slacker "" is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end . \nsince linklater only spends a few minutes with each character , the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while . \nthere are only so many times you can hear , "" hey , what\'s going on ?

1,"b'\'contact\' shows why jodie foster is one of our best actresses . \nsee contact with your family . \nit is a movie for all ages . \n--a review by stuart cracraft \ncontact starring : jodie foster , matthew mcconaughey , john hurt director : robert zemeckis star \nafter a predictable mit phillip morrison powers-of-10 zoom-out start ( which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof . morrison\'s work ) , contact picks up steam , gradually , building , by-the-end , an irresistable juggernaut and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out-of-balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological "" geek "" side . \nby the end , the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do : evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what\'s out there . \nthis movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high-tech movies . \nhowever , except for jodie foster ( elie arroway ) and john hurt ( s . r . \nhadden ) , who are both actors of exceptional caliber , the supporting cast are not especially impressive . \nhurt certainly has had better roles ( stephen ward in scandal ) . \nthis one , as the multi-billionare hadden , does not do his acting skills justice . \nthis is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation . \nfoster\'s radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms . \nearly scenes take a long , long time to build up to this . \nthe movie\'s pacing is very good and subtle . \nthe panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful . \nthe politics of foster\'s character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however . \none of the most entertaining , but very short scenes , is when foster is confronted by rob lowe , during a cabinet-level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation . \nthere were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored . \nit is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters . \neverything else was very one-sided ( e . g . \nfoster ) . \nlowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table . \nthe core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far-away world in the starsystem of vega . \nit feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley\'s scenes in his book steel beach , where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence , in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself , and in foster\'s case , an illusion drawn from her memory . \nin another sense , this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry\'s star trek pilot the cage , later the menagerie , when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens . \nthe concept is not new , by any sense , in the world of science fiction . \nbut the beach scene , which is the centerpiece of the film , as is the whole film , is driven by foster . \nfreed from her needs to direct by director zemecki , foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast . \nas the movie gains speed , foster\'s acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her . \nit is certainly oscar-caliber acting , unquestionably . \nthe supporting cast does well and zemeckis throws in some humor with some president clinton cameos , cleverly manipulated , george stephanopolus-style , to seem very forrest gump . \nin fact , zemeckis et . \nal . \ngot in trouble for the usage of some of the footage seen in the movie , vis a vis clinton . \nbut the audience i attended this movie with just had some good chuckles at clinton\'s walk-ons . \nthe much-discussed tension between science and religion in this movie is not particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course though it is helpful to those in the audience who have not . \nalso , the near-final scene , in a senate judiciary hearing room is disappointing . \ncontact is a fitting memorial to the memory of carl sagan , science popularizer , and sometime pedantic gadfly of the halls of academe . \nperhaps now , sagan can be said to be with his dragons of eden . \n'"
1,"b'until i saw the night of the hunter , it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie . \nforget the others and the deep end ( which veered toward strained dramatics ) , the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i\'ve seen so far this year . \neven though the movie is nearly 50 years old and there\'s a not drop of blood to be seen . \nluckily , the night of the hunter , charles laughton\'s first and final directing gig , has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being re-released in october 2001 . \nso , there\'s still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place . \nrobert mitchum stars as harry powell , a reverend with a nasty habit of courting and then killing widows for their cash . \nhis newest target is young mother willa harper ( shelley winters ) , whose murderer husband ben ( peter graves ) has hidden $10 , 000 somewhere . \npowell finds out about the stash and decides to court mrs . harper after he\'s released and ben is hanged . \nbut finding the money isn\'t easy for powell , who must contend with his stepchildren ( billy chapin and sally jane bruce ) , who know where the money is , but aren\'t telling . \nthe hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments , thus ruining the spontaneity and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time . \nhow many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies ? \nwhat about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin ? \n ( no , i\'m not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem . ) \nyes , there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter . \npowell\'s "" love "" and "" hate "" knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing ( remember radio raheem ? ) . \nand powell\'s black suit , with black tie and white shirt , could have shaped quentin tarantino\'s early visual style . \nseeing the night of the hunter for the first time , i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact . \nyou can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club . \nhe plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears . \nhe\'s like the senior class president with an evil streak . \nif i ever need to stay awake , i\'ll just picture him crooning , "" leaning . . . \nleaning . . . . "" \nany actor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil should study his performance the way a rabbinical student studies the torah . \nand credit must be handed out to laughton and cinematographer stanley cortez , who create a series of haunting , surreal shadowy images over the rural depression-era backdrop . \nit\'s a testament to both men that they\'re able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline ( kids harassed by evil guardians ) by sticking to the old maxim that we\'re more scared by what we don\'t see . \nscreenwriter and legendary film critic james agee does a beautiful job giving shape and substance to an array of supporting characters : the drunk birdie ( james gleason ) who\'s haunted by his wife , and the spoons ( evelyn varden and walt spoon ) whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act . \nthe only lapse is the movie\'s third act , when pearl and john run away from home and find a home with the motherly , bible-reading mrs . cooper ( lillian gish ) . \nher showdown with powell is memorable -- a battle done with dueling hymns . \nhowever , the whole segment feels a little rushed and underdone , but it\'s still a thrill seeing the queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun . \ndo yourself favor and don\'t miss this if it comes to a nearby theater . \nnote : a series of revealing , but overlong , outtakes preceded the movie . \nthe highlights included the legendary laughton ( who sounds eerily like mr . pitt from seinfeld ) running winters\' lines with mitchum , and the adorable , tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile . \nhours more of such footage exists , as laughton liked to keep the cameras constantly rolling . \nscreened as part of the 2001 new york film festival retrospectives ( feature story coming soon ) . \n'"
1,"b""all those who were offended by there's something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie , a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch . \nand while this uproariously funny , gross-out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste , it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end . \namerican pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season . \ni must question the studio that releases a movie like this . \nthe producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd , but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r-rated film . \nsome have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 , a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie . \namerican pie was threatened with an nc-17 , but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product , it was given an r . but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park . \nit is sick , perverse , and ultimately disgusting - not to mention extremely funny . \namerican pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night . \njim ( jason biggs ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) , oz ( chris klein ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead . \njim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base , to which one of his friends replies : `like warm apple pie . . . ' . \nof course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner . \nthere are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game-plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief . \namerican pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it . \ni loved the young cast in this movie . \nconsider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances . \nbiggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise . \nbut in a teen-dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television's sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim's uneasy father . \nscenes in which the familiar father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie . \nafter levy discovers jim's new use for apple pie , he tells him , `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age . \nbut i never used baked goods . ' \nit is performances such as his , and bill murray's in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out . \nthere are some less-than-original aspects of the film . \na bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex-lax is something we've seen before . \nif weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother's dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect . \nsecondly , the characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing . \nbut at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it's own , biggs asks his buddies why he's going through so much pressure for something that's `not very important anyway . ' \nand so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate , it still manages to be mature . \nin it's own way . \n"""

1,"b'the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola\'s 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . \nmartin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . \nunfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola\'s influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . \nseventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . \nthis film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . \ngoodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) . \nthe book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york . \nat the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands . \nafter couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) . \nthree of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history . \nwealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business . \nbut the perfect world of "" wiseguys "" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy\'s unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy\'s reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry\'s own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends . \ngoodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory . \nscorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker . \nworld depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating . \nscorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny . \nafter being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens . \nscorsese also manages to break viewer\'s moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience . \nwith the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character\'s dialogue or narrator\'s commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era . \neven if we don\'t pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker . \nfirst , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie\'s ironic prologue . \nthen , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards . \nthis multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation . \nsame ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack . \nnostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s . \nbut the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed . \nhowever , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people . \nsuch scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s . \nfragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn\'t have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese . \nhe uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious "" a day in life "" segment near the end of the film . \nanother essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents . \nthe most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues . \njoe pesci deserved his "" oscar "" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film . \nray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn\'t look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film . \nliotta\'s henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs . \nliotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction . \nlorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband . \npaul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave . \nas a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time . \nbecause of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s . \n'"
1,"b'what surprises me most about the long-awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker . \nthe dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis ! \ni can hear batfans everywhere protesting : "" first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman , and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! ! "" \nand , indeed , this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play . \nnicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding , oscar-worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman . \nnicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the \'60s tv series ) . \non one hand , nicholson\'s joker is extremely funny . \nhis murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film . \nbut on the other hand , his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind . \nthe joker\'s cruelty and demented , diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister . \nthis guy is off his rocker , and he not only knows it , he flaunts it ! \nbut enough about nicholson as the joker : i\'m sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman . \nlike many , i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader . \nbut batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting ! \nkeaton delivers . \nhe is convincing as the tormented millionaire , bruce wayne , and beneath his hard , black body armor , he is mysterious and formidable as the batman . \neven though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character , keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city . \nvisually , batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team . \nthe movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak , gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as "" the dark knight returns "" and "" the killing joke .

"" \nhis grimacing smile , green hair , and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous . \nkeaton\'s wardrobe is equally appropriate . \nbatman\'s cape , mask , and body armor make him look threatening , frightening , and invincible bringing to mind not adam west\'s campy costume in the tv series but peter weir\'s outfit in robocop . \nproduction designer anton furst\'s sets are a wonder . \ngotham city is dark and foreboding , almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york . \nthe batcave is cold , bare , and desolate . \nthe world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption . \nthe movie\'s gritty bladerunner/robocop look is a joy to behold . \nthe plot , on the other hand , is not as rousing . \nthe screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting . \nit takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear . \nbatman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology , but it fails to give us enough of either one . \nas i mentioned earlier , the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker , but it never fully establishes batman\'s psychological motives and underpinnings . \nin terms of action , batman is not as thrilling as you might expect . \nburton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story . \nmore than anything , batman is a mood film . \nwhile batman may not completely absorb and excite you , it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books . \nthanks to its distinctive look , the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world . \n'"

"" \nhe says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children . \npicking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of "" the pied piper "" from an old , illustrated book to her two charges . \nperiodically throughout the picture , nicole\'s readings are heard in voice-over . \nyou have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment . \nthey and the rest of the town\'s children come into harm\'s way -- some live and others are seriously injured . \nand the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again . \nalthough the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss . \nian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery . \nmitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow-encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness . \nhis mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf . \nif this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot . \nthe story unfolds slowly and always believably . \neach little aspect has its own fascination . \nas mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker , played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson , he has a simple task . \nhe wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit . \nwendell ticks off one town member after another and then , as one can in a small town , enumerates each person\'s numerous faults . \nalthough the town is no peyton place , people there do have their foibles . \none of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good-bye to his kids . \nwell , single parent billy\'s fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita . \nhis confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story . \nthe accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn\'t shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film . \nalthough the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy . \nas the injured bus driver , gabrielle rose , dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning . \nto round out the story , mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear . \nhis daughter zoe ( caerthan banks ) is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half-way house and recovery center after another . \nfond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help , she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk . \n ( "" i can help you , "" mitchell tries to reassure billy . \n "" not unless you can raise the dead , "" billy snaps back . \nmitchell\'s pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder . ) \nmychael danna\'s haunting music sets the stage for tragedy . \nthe cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur , but it is in the warm , shadowy , intimate moments indoors where it works best . \nthe show , which is ripe for emotional manipulation , never plays with its audience . \nstill , when the house lights go up , you may feel as i did . \ni could barely breathe ; i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed . \nmore than anything , the film is like a master painting . \neach cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint . \nwith the final color in place , the masterpiece is complete , and the ending credits roll . \nthe sweet hereafter runs 1 : 50 . \nit is rated r for mature themes , sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers . \n'"
1,"b'this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989 . \nwhether it was the meddling of studio executives , or the work of writer/director james cameron himself , the original cut of this underwater sci-fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed . \nthe main problem was fairly simple : the film\'s climax was unworthy of its build-up . \nsomeone at 20th century fox - and no doubt cameron himself - must have agreed , because in 1993 came the theatrical release of the abyss : special edition . \nnow available on video , it seems timely to re-evaluate what , in its newly revamped state , is now a near-masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010 : odyssey two , alien and close encounters of third kind . \nthe plot is thus . \nwe meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard-nosed lindsay ( mastrantonio ) and captained by her soon-to-be-divorced husband bud ( ed harris ) . \nthe rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u . s . nuclear submarine . \nrequiring a dive part-way down a three mile deep trench , three navy divers arrive to command the operation , led by the edgy lieutenant coffey ( biehn ) . \nbut a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they\'re dealing with , as she memorably puts it , "" aren\'t speaking russian "" . \nmeanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing and , even worse , a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous u . s . navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions . \nthis crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig , with the trigger-happy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goings-on around them . \nthe human drama is often riveting , with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in cameron\'s aliens . \nthe stunts , hardware , special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding . \nand so they should be : cameron\'s technical credentials are well established . \nbut what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands : 1 ) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and ex-hubby bud ; 2 ) the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis\' befall them ; and 3 ) the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss . \nthe abyss : special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects . \none is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay , a relationship at times touching , at others incredibly intense and volatile . \nthe second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the film\'s end , when the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying and extraordinary display of power to a world on the brink of nuclear war . \nwith the inclusion of these startling scenes , the story\'s climax is now given real weight . \nwhy on earth were they left out of the original ? \nthis reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible . \nso then , we have 25 minutes of additional footage that\'s turned a decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent . \ni say "" quite "" because some flaws do remain . \nthe most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz - some new , some old - that may well have you reaching for the barf bag . \nnonetheless , the abyss : special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron\'s greatest achievements , alongside aliens and terminator 2 . see it and be moved , gripped and spellbound . \n'"

1,"b'devotees of robert a . heinlein , be forewarned : paul verhoeven\'s starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein\'s novel than it is a literary satire . \nthe author\'s jingo-all-the-way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless , faceless parade of carnage from the film version . \nand i suppose that\'s exactly what verhoeven delivers , with sometimes hilarious results . \nheinlein\'s basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement , while their strengths become the stuff of high-energy entertainment . \noutlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor , since it\'s basically a big bug hunt . . . aliens in broad daylight . \nsometime in the future , humanity is threatened by giant , malevolent insects which have evolved into twenty-foot-tall action figures ( arachnids with super-impaling spikes , beetles that spew forth lava , dragonflies with guillotine legs ) . \namong those who sign on to save the earth are a group of high school classmates from buenos aires : conflicted rich kid johnny rico ( casper van dien ) ; his math whiz girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; dizzy ( dina meyer ) , who secretly carries a torch for johnny ; and carl ( neil patrick "" doogie howser "" harris ) , who not-so-secretly carries a torch for dizzy , and also has a talent for speaking telepathically to ferrets . \nwhile carmen heads for flight school and carl joins military intelligence , johnny and dizzy become mobile infantry , their various battles intertwining with romantic sub-plots out of a third season episode from "" beverly hills 90210 . "" \nso if starship troopers is another movie where one-dimensional characters wade through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of aliens , what makes it any better than , say , independence day , a movie where one-dimensional characters waded through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of slightly different aliens ? \nfor one thing , you sense that the film-makers are aware of the pulp nonsense they have as source material . \nthe very absence of major stars in the cast feels thematically appropriate , not just fiscally prudent . \nif starship troopers had been turned into a tv-movie , aaron spelling would have produced it . \nit\'s a story which requires emoting , not acting ; it\'s a prime time soap opera with big guns , played for all the dopey melodrama it\'s worth . \nthe no-name cast also plays into verhoeven\'s treatment of heinlein\'s most controversial conceit . \nin this society , we learn , one can only be a full citizen after completing some sort of federal service , military for most . \nverhoeven pays the notion plenty of lip service , then proceeds to skewer it with brilliant mock recruitment ads ( named after the world war ii-era "" why we fight "" series ) in which youngsters are indoctrinated into the joys of firearms , or the pleasures of stomping cockroaches . \nthese characters really are just "" fresh meat for the grinder , "" as one character puts it , which makes their lack of familiarity all the more fitting . \nit\'s not that starship troopers is anti-military , because it never treats the true horror of war as anything but a great big , violent video game . \nin fact , the characters are living the propaganda ( particularly johnny , who receives so many field promotions he may not remember his own rank by the time the film ends ) . \nverhoeven is actually having it both ways -- he\'s making fun of gung-ho boosterism even as he fires his fresh-faced recruits into battle on a gung-ho booster rocket of visual effects . \nif that makes starship troopers hypocritical , at least it\'s enthusiastically staged hypocrisy . \nthere may not be a person worth caring about in the whole film , but it moves like nobody\'s business . \nverhoeven stages some thrilling action sequences , sending swarms of bugs after the anonymous grunts then having various body parts strewn about the screen like landscaping . \nit is that rare special effects blockbuster which demonstrates a sense of pacing to match its budget ; i was caught up in the action enough of the time that i wasn\'t perpetually groaning over the absence of real human beings . \ni wish i could find it in myself to work up more outrage over the callous way humans are dispatched in starship troopers , but it didn\'t work out that way . \nthat would be punishing verhoeven for getting to the heart of his material . \n'"

"" \nstarring john leguizamo , mira sorvino , adrian brody , jennifer esposito , michael rispoli , bebe neuwirth . \nrated r . \nsummer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lee\'s abilities . \nlee is a great filmmaker , often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg . \nbut here , he gets himself into a bind . \nhis latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work . \nthe summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city . \nit was the hottest summer on record . \nto boot , new york\'s first serial killer was on the loose : calling himself the son of sam , david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population . \nso it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout , people went berserk , causing billions of dollars in damage to the city . \nthe movie\'s focus is on a group of twenty-somethings during that fateful summer : vinny ( john leguizamo ) , a club-hopping , adultrous hairdresser , his benevolent wife dionna ( mira sorvino , looking young ) , ritchie ( adrian brody ) , a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect , a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters . \nwe follow them through their roller coaster lives , thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings . \nvinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him , make him stay faithful to her . \nritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more "" eccentric , "" and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend . \ntensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam\'s first murder looms ; the night he promises he will strike again . \na local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects . \nat the top of the list is ritchie . \nvinny , an unwilling part of the said group , is called upon to set a trap for his friend . \nas we watch these proceedings , some of which are painfully graphic , the dreaded "" so what ? "" \nquestion springs to mind . \nfrom the way this movie is made , i\'d have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find . \nlee touches on so much -- the media , the 70\'s punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters\' very personal dilemmas -- but he doesn\'t bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement . \nall is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable . \ntoo bad summer of sam doesn\'t get any help here . \nfrankly , it\'s a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn\'t entertain beyond its first half hour . \nthere is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague . \nleguizamo\'s turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny . \nthe script makes it clear that we\'re supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy . \nyou\'d never guess from his performance . \nadrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better . \nsorvino gives a riveting , touching performance in a banal movie ( i\'m tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane ) ; her character is affecting and her emotions true-to-heart . \nbrody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for . \nsummer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it\'s pretty well directed , in a purely technical way . \nbut it\'s also empty , pretentious and boring . \nlike last year\'s the thin red line , it\'s a movie by a director who doesn\'t know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n'"

1,"b'i know that "" funnest "" isn\'t a word . \n "" fun "" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . \nbut that\'s the word that came to me right after viewing "" chicken run . "" \nno wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like "" that was the funnest movie i\'ve ever seen ! "" \nso to hell with webster\'s -- "" chicken run "" is one of the funnest movies i\'ve seen in a while . \ni can\'t remember the last time i\'ve seen anything funner . \nthe chickens at tweedy\'s farm are up to something . \nliving in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . \none night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . \nrocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm\'s egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . \nshe orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , "" chickens go in ; pies come out . "" \nwhat sort of pies ? \nchicken pies , of course . \nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave . "" \nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \npart of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park\'s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \n "" the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run . "" \nthe plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \nthing is , the film doesn\'t feel like it\'s been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it\'s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \nbut they\'re * chickens * , so it\'s funny to us . \nanother thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park\'s films ) succeed is the animators\' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they\'re cribbing . \nthere are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17 . "" \nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom . "" \nthere\'s even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson\'s nationality and film history . \nthe "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution . \nconsider this : since july of last year , i\'ve seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \nwhy ? \nbecause once you got past the thought that "" they\'re parodying that \'blair witch\' movie , "" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \nconversely , "" chicken run "" doesn\'t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \nif you\'ve never seen "" indiana jones , "" the chase sequence is still fun . \neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it\'s understood , and as a result , "" chicken run "" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \nenjoyment of this movie doesn\'t require knowledge of film history , but if you\'ve got it , "" chicken run "" is that much richer . \nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it\'s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on "" absolutely fabulous "" ) nails it . \nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \nthe characters\' inevitable romance doesn\'t feel contrived , but sweet . \npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn\'t any help . \njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that\'s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of "" chicken run , "" it comes as a delightful surprise . \nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \nthe animation is first-rate . \nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable "" chicken run "" really is . \nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios\' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \nas in such top-notch family fare as "" a bug\'s life "" or "" toy story 2 , "" "" chicken run "" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they\'ll catch all the details . \nanyway , the movie\'s just a boatload of fun . \nfunnest damn movie i\'ve seen all year . \n'"

0,"b'the crown jewel of 1970\'s irwin allen disaster movies , the poseidon adventure features an all-star cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship . \nthe story begins on the u . s . s . \nposeidon\'s big new year\'s cruise , where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive . \nlet\'s see , there\'s the new age preacher ( hackman ) who advises people to "" pray to that part of god within yourself .

1,"b'robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible , god-given gifts , but are able to act like ordinary people . \nin "" the natural "" ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be "" the best there ever was , "" but still acted like a humble farm boy . \nin "" butch cassidy and the sundance kid "" ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good-looking charmer . \neven in "" indecent proposal "" ( 1993 ) , where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love , redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency , especially when reciting a tale of lost love . \nin his latest film , "" the horse whisperer , "" based on the best-selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character . \nredford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up . \ndespite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase "" horse whisperer "" to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life . \nbooker\'s talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident . \nthe accident , which is filmed with gut-wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen-wheeler kills grace\'s friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace\'s horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg . \nannie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker . \nat first , she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse , but that doesn\'t work . \ninstead , she packs up grace and pilgrim , leaves her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister-in-law , diane ( dianne wiest ) . \nin many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically . \nthe move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it\'s hard not to see annie and grace\'s leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs . country . \nin "" the horse whisperer , "" country is clearly the victor . \nthe city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide-open spaces of montana that grace\'s anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie\'s controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people . \nredford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed "" a river runs through it "" six years ago . \nin many ways , "" the horse whisperer "" comes from the same poetic vein as "" river , "" and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera-time on the grass and mountains . \nbut then , that would ruin the magic . \nmuch of the film\'s photography is truly elegant , and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land . \nto further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( "" natural born killers , "" "" platoon "" ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio . \nin terms of the story itself , "" the horse whisperer "" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean\'s "" a brief encounter "" ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood\'s 1995 adaptation of robert james waller\'s "" the bridges of madison county "" ( richard lagravenese , co-screenwriter here also adapted "" bridges "" ) . \nalthough "" the horse whisperer "" has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story . \nit seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who\'s being left behind for this brief , heart-sweeping affair , but there rarely is . \nin "" the horse whisperer , "" the thankless role of being the fuddy-duddy husband falls to sam neill . \nhe plays the character as a decent , hard-working man who is a good husband and father ; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him . \nhe is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man . \nthere is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character . \nit shows booker and robert going into a horse pen - booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out-of-place in a baseball cap . \nas they enter the pen , booker assuredly swings over the fence , while robert hesitates , then opens the gate and , in a goofy moment , forgets to close it behind him . \nit\'s a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie\'s thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness . \nafter all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it . \nthe best scenes in "" the horse whisperer "" tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse . \nalthough booker\'s horse-training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing . \nthese are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true . \nat some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more . \nnevertheless , redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film . \nthere are no dramatic sex scenes , but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow-dancing , always moving ever closer together , that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together . \nalthough the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character , there are enough moments like that which make "" the horse whisperer "" worth the price of admission . \n'"
1,"b'there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review , not because of their own complexity , but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original . \none of such masterpieces is casablanca , probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art , but definitely the most popular one . \nits popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere , but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day . \ncasablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience . \none of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail , at least judging by conventional movie-making wisdom of its time . \nit was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn\'t been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g . epstein , philip j . epstein and howard koch - was beeing written as shooting went along ; the main actors were producers\' second choice , and , finally , man behind camera , michael curtiz was considered to be capable , but not great director . \nhowever , the movie was commercially successful and earned three "" oscars "" , including the one for the best film . \nuntil this very day , it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film- making in its own golden age . \nthe plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda , yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story . \nin december 1941 , casablanca , exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral , yet nazi-collaborating french vichy government . \nthousands of refugees from war-torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america , and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas . \nmany shady characters thrive on their misery , including the corrupt police chief , captain renault ( rains ) . \nhis best friend is rick blaine ( bogart ) , who used to be idealistic anti-fascist , and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of "" sticking his neck for nobody "" . \nhowever , everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas . \nthis event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca . \none of them is victor laszlo ( henreid ) , czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe . \nhe is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund ( bergman ) , with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris . \nthe couple needs visas , especially because of the gestapo major strasser ( veidt ) being on their trail . \nrick is now forced to choose between love , wounded pride , self-preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism . \nthe casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration - humphrey bogart , most legendary actor in the history of cinema , is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status . \nbogart\'s portrayal of rick as complicated man , torn between idealistic past and bitter present , was so perfect , that his icon would forever be connected with that character . \nanother icon in his company is ingrid bergman , great actress of old hollywood , here in her artistic and visual prime . \nthe cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when the romance on the screen didn\'t look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works . \nfor many people , casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made . \nbut the reason for that isn\'t the romance itself - it\'s the realistic story of people forced to make tough , and often wrong choices in their life . \nthe casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads . \nthe supporting actors also did a marvellous job . \nsidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston\'s maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters . \nanother shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle ; character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny . \nunfortunately , the charisma that burdened laszlo , leaves little place for difficult choice , making his character forever overshadowed by rick/ilsa coupling . \nhowever , rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca . \ncaptain renault , brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime , was embodiment of perfect , almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm . \ndespite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie , rains managed to make renault sympathetic character , and his final conversion to the side of good , symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary . \nrains also gave another dimension to the movie , making it even more ambiguous ;

0,"b'chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get a reaction from -- you either find his helium voice , crazy eyes and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying . \ni think i fall into the former category ( i\'m one of the few who thought his turn in "" the fifth element "" as a prancing , prince-like deejay was complete inspired lunacy and not the least bit aggravating ) , but his new vehicle "" money talks "" just doesn\'t do him service . \ntucker is good in the movie -- and this is the kind of film that , if people see it , could make him a big star -- but he\'s also really the only thing good about the movie . \nin fact , if you see "" money talks , "" it should shock you beyond recognition that two of "" toy story "" \'s writers penned the sloppy script . \ntucker\'s role here is that of franklin hatchett , a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell ( charlie sheen ) . \nafter being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports , franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard ( gerard ismael ) . \nbut villard\'s thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader ( never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him ) , and because he and franklin are joined at the wrist , franklin is allowed to escape as well , but not before overhearing some important information regarding a diamond stash that -- for some reason or another -- is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo . \nthe local media mistakenly puts the prison break-out blame on franklin , which is where james comes back into the picture . \nhe makes a deal to protect franklin if , in turn , franklin gives him an exclusive interview . \nthis means james must present his new "" friend "" in the stickiest of situations -- a formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace ( heather locklear ) , also attended by her uber-rich parents ( veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino ) . \nand of course the bad guys track franklin down and try to knock him off , all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james . \n "" this ain\'t no buddy movie , "" claim the print ads . \nyeah , right . \nactually , for the better part of , oh , 20 minutes , it appears "" money talks "" has the momentum to cover entertaining ground , and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker . \nthis is tucker\'s first leading role , and if you imagine a slightly lankier , african-american jim carrey with a reliance on wild r-rated raunch rather than pg-13 physical comedy , you have a good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role . \nbut you realize all too quickly that tucker\'s overstated liveliness is the only thing "" money talks "" has going for it . \nand a lively actor alone does not a successful movie make . \nit\'s all too easy to pick out everything wrong with "" money talks . "" \nthe plot is recycled buddy-buddy comedy-thriller tripe that seemed overused even when "" nothing to lose "" employed it last month . \neverything is paint-by-numbers , especially the los angeles coliseum finale , which finds not one , not two , but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers . \nthe villains , as many as there are , are dull . \ncertain story elements are too coincidental . \nand too much of the film\'s dramatic agenda is played too straight . \na scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin\'s true identity ( "" you brought a killer into my parents\' house !

"" \nbut the people around me appeared to be having a rip-roaring good time ( one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health ) . \nbut tucker , at least for me , is a pretty funny guy , and aces the movie\'s best scene , where franklin passes himself off as vic damone\'s son at james and grace\'s engagement bash and toasts the couple with barry white lyrics . \ntucker\'s audience -- and he does have one -- will probably like "" money talks .

0,"b""i love movies . \ni really do . \nevery time i watch great movies like goodfellas ( 1990 ) or raiders of the lost ark ( 1981 ) , a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent , skill and entertainment that is on display . \neven lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1/3 ( 1994 ) or ghostbusters ii ( 1988 ) while not exactly brilliantly well made , are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value . \nthen there's my favourite martian , the exact opposite of what a movie should be : a hurried , poorly written and acted movie with one goal , to make money . \ndisney , ever since the lion king ( 1994 ) have lost their magic touch , but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk . \nchristopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t . v reporter's tim o'hara car ( daniels ) , and soon tim finds the martian in his home , trying to recover and fix his spaceship . \nalong with his 'zoot' spacesuit , voiced by wayne knight , must fix his spaceship before it explodes , and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public , firstly by o'hara , but later by rival t . v presenter brace channing ( hurley ) , by calling himself tim's 'uncle martin . ' \n'laughter' is supposed to arise from the 'comical' events , but never does . \nmany bad films have good intentions , but my favourite martian doesn't appear to try to provide any entertainment . \nfilled to the brim with wham bang special effects , my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy . \nchristopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie , i've never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now . \njeff daniels plays 'staple nice guy' and his role is useless . \nhis performance is incredibly lazy , although his paperthin character doesn't deserve more than the performance he gives . \ndarryl hannah looks as pretty as ever , but her role is somewhat , erm , limited . \nhurley mistakes 'acting' for 'shouting and looking like a twit' and wins the david wilcock award for 'most irritating , godawful performance in a moving picture .

' \nbefore finally giving up and switching off . \nanother major setback is the staple 'comedy sidekick . ' \nunfortunately , the writers ( sherri stoner and deanna oliver , if anyone cares ) forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be 'funny .

0,"b'watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute \'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey . \nif the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star . \nalas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs . \nwhat that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars . \nthat\'s pretty generous , considering the movie\'s camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek . \nwhen will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it . \nso why such a seemingly high rating ? \nthere are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage . \nfirst , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater . \nthe sound and screen kicked ass . \nnobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don\'t necessarily mean that in a good way ) . \nalso , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie\'s tension . \ni even liked the computer-generated settings . \ni usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i\'ve seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities . \nalso , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain . \nwilliam hurt isn\'t too bad either . \nneither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable . \nand perhaps i shouldn\'t admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood . \nthere is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a "" real "" kiss -- no sex ) . \nit felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six . \nthose movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven . \nthat type of moviemaking is a lost art . \nnow for the bad news . \nworst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue . \nit\'s squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction . \n "" you better hold on to your joystick , "" is one such line . \nand when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign . \nsecond worst , and closely related , is the screenplay . \nthe story\'s exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what\'s happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest . \nonce the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived . \nwhen gary oldman easily reprograms will\'s pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : "" he flipped the switch to \'evil . \' "" \nthen there\'s the tone of the movie . \nthe colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson . \nthen it could be an adventure movie . \nthey\'re mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn\'t a good enough actor to carry it off . \nstill , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination . \njust because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn\'t mean that we have to bow to a "" promise keepers "" notion of who\'s the center of a family . \nmany quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect . \nand the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie . \nin star wars , the rebels were the good guys . \nwe were rooting for those who were fighting against the system . \nin lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free . \nthat ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists . \nfinally , a few specific details deserve criticism . \nthe movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 . \nwhy ? \nwhy bother saying what year this is . \njust tell us it\'s the future . \ni bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 . \nsetting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won\'t be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) . \nthen there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole . \nthis silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny\'s barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven\'t learned a thing about ergonomics . \none vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool . \nthe strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip . \nthis is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie . \nbut if that\'s the best part of the movie , i can\'t in good conscience recommend it . \nstill , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your "" bad movie bingo "" cards . \n'"

0,"b'i still can\'t figure out why people went in droves to see this movie . \nnow before you go assuming i\'m some sort of high brow snob , who can\'t appreciate a little dumb humor , let me say that i love cheap humor . \ni thought there\'s something about mary was one of the funniest films that i have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998 . \nlow brow adolescent humor can be a lot of fun , the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent , there is no humor component . \ni wanted to like the waterboy , i really did . \ni think i only laughed maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire movie . \nactually , i smiled a couple of more times on top of that . \nnot a great record for a 90-minute film . \nthe problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies . \nthose responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using a goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is a substitute for actual funny material . \nnothing could be further from the truth , as matter of fact , sandler\'s idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film . \nit\'s really a shame too , because this film had the potential to be very funny . \ni personally believe that sandler is probably a very talented comedian , it\'s just that so far he hasn\'t been able to find the right film to showcase his talents . \nif his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons , my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live . \nmost of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry . \nsandler plays a 31-year-old , somewhat mentally challenged , waterboy for a college football team . \nthe team\'s somewhat mentally disturbed coach ( henry winkler ) realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pent-up rage , which , if harnessed properly , would make him a force to be reckoned with on the football field . \nyou can figure out the rest from here . \nsandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star . \nas i said , the film had a great deal of potential . \nthe idea was a decent one , but the main potential of this movie is a result of the cast . \nall of whom are very good , just hamstrung by really , really , lousy material . \neven sandler , annoying goofy voice and all , has enough charisma and natural comedic ability to overcome some of his bad material . \neven as unfunny as his character is , i still found myself rooting for him throughout the film . \nbut it is the supporting cast that i feel most badly about . \nif their material had been just a bit better , this film could have been such a funny movie . \nfairuza balk plays sandler\'s leather-wearing biker-chick love interest and does a great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time . \nwinkler is great as the coach who uses a "" coaching for dummies "" -style book to help him get through games . \nthe real standout though , is kathy bates . \neven with some of the worst material of her career to deal with , she is still a treat to watch in her role as sandler\'s overprotective and overbearing mama . \neven with the performances of bates and winkler , there is absolutely no way i would recommend this movie . \nalthough i get the distinct impression that without them , this film would have ranked in negative numbers for me . \nwhich is sad , because i can\'t really put my finger on a particular element of the movie and single it out as the cause of the disaster that it became . \nit\'s obvious that those involved , specifically the actors , tried very hard to make what they thought was going to be a funny movie . \nit\'s just too bad that 99 percent of all of the jokes fell flat . \n'"
1,"b'i was anxious to see this for a long time . \na friend of mine recommended this to me because he has a crush on neve campbell , and he wanted to prove that she\'s as hot as he thinks he is . \nhe proved it for me all right , but the reasons i enjoy this film go way beyond that . \nscream treads on familar ground , horror movie with , as star neve campbell puts it , "" some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who can\'t act who\'s always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door . "" \nit\'s very familar , your typical horror film . \nso why , you may ask after watching it , does it seem so new and original ? \nbecause it treats itself as if it hasn\'t been done before , and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old , familar tired stuff . \nthis raises another question : how does it do this ? \nsimple : the characters . \nthey\'re not your typical stupid horror film victims who don\'t know what the hell to do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask and a machette . \nthey are horror fans , they know how stuff happens in a horror movie , they know what to do and what not to do , and that makes it scary , and even funny at certain times . \nyou can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker ( drew barrymore ) is making popcorn , getting ready to watch a video , and some guy who sounds like a killer calls her up to play a game with her that involves horror movie triva that , if she gets it wrong , will get her and her boyfriend killed . \nshe knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions , she just can\'t answer his final question , "" what door am i at ? "" \nand that gets her killed . \nthat scene works because in a normal horror film , half the things that happen in that scene would never happen . \nthe plot is typical horror stuff : sidney prescott ( an impressive neve campbell ) , an attractive young high school student who\'s mother was killed a year ago tommorrow , is being stalked by a killer who\'s previously murdered one of her classmates ( casey , naturally ) , and everybody in this small , california town is a suspect , including sidney\'s boyfriend , billy loomis . \nbut as i said before , these people know how horror movies work , and that\'s what makes it so appealing . \nthat and the references to horror movies , like when casey says , "" the first ( nightmare on elm street ) was scary , but the rest sucked . "" \nwhich is obviously director wes craven ( who does a good job of poking fun of the genre that made him a legend ) patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie and none of the others , and when tatum , sidney\'s friend , mentions the director , wes carpenter , which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to not only craven , but also director john carpenter . \nthe cast is well chosen , neve campbell pulls off a good heroine ( and unlike most horror film heroines , she * can * act ) , drew barrymore does a good janet leigh impression for what little time she has in the film , and david arquette is impressive . \nalso good ( and funny ) in his role is henry winkler ( "" the fonz "" ) as the school principal . \ni took half a point off for the unnecessary ( albeit limited ) appearance by friends\' courteney cox as reporter , gail edwards , sidney\'s rival because she covered her mother\'s disappearance . \ni hate that show , i hate those actors . \nthey\'re untalented , overexposed , and overpaid , imho , and i would think wes craven is smart enough to know those actors are overexposed enough , but i suppose he isn\'t . \n'"

1,"b'as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot , mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences . \nyou know the type : his shirt is always shredded , his face always scarred , he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a "" to kill "" list for his enemies . \noscar-hungry director/executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to , but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century . \nas gibson delivers lines like , "" before this war is over , i am going to kill you , "" schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind . \noddly enough , the patriot is as much an epic three-hour-tear-fest like gladiator , as it is a ninety-minute guilty pleasure . \nat times absorbing , at others enjoyably insipid , this is good , bloody summer fun . \ni probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend . \nsome of the images are so zealously americanized ( the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example ) , that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it . \nlike emmerich\'s id4 , this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all . \nsure it\'s predictable and melodramatic , but for a moment after leaving the theater , i was dumbfounded with patriotism . \nand isn\'t that the point of the patriot ? \ngibson plays benjamin martin , the lionized french and indian war veteran , who , at the beginning of the film , is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away . \nhe is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants ( not slaves ! ) . \nas the revolutionary war rumbles miles away , martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields . \nbut when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel ( jason isaacs ) , martin quickly decides to save the day ( or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich ) . \nforming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war , martin becomes the number one target of the british army . \nthe best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right . \nevery time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy , to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis\' ( tom wilkinson ) face was priceless entertainment . \nand as the tension gradually formulates with the running time , a final battle is inevitable . \nas for the numerous battle scenes , they are expertly done . \nclearer and more realistic than those of gladiator , the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating . \nyou really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period . \neverything is performed in an orderly ( but still quite gory ) fashion - one side shoots , then the other side , then the remaining soldiers charge . \nit\'s organized , strategic and , according to martin , ineffective . \nthere is a very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martin\'s take-no-prisoners method . \nwhat drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions , are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington . \nplayed wonderfully by jason isaacs , tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians , who nervously avoid eye contact . \nthis character is viciously evil ; he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home ; even his eyes are evil . \nhis portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain , some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as "" cowardly "" and "" sadistic . "" \ni disagree with this accusation . \ntavington does not represent his country ; his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general . \nbesides tavington , the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized . \nand stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies - why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys ? \nheck , why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys ? \nthe patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks . \nwith an action hero seeking revenge and a comic book villain ready to take him down , it\'s a lethal weapon for the colonial times . \ngod bless america ! \nand god bless the patriot ! \n'"

1,"b'before even seeing a single frame of the film , it would be easy to snicker at deep impact , in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet . \nit is the latest entry in this decade\'s dubious revival of the \'70s disaster film , and the first of two "" the sky is falling "" flicks to hit screens this year ( the other being this coming july\'s armageddon , in which a meteor is the threat ) . \nits tagline , "" oceans rise . \ncities fall . \nhope survives "" is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight ( "" they came in alone . . . the only way out . . . \nis together "" ) , but it\'s every bit as treacly . \nthe opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at . \nthe cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions , such as the usual opening "" roll call , "" in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced . \nthe most prominent of the "" personal "" stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner ( tea leoni ) , who is distraught that her father ( maximilian schell ) left her mother ( vanessa redgrave ) for a younger woman ( rya kihlstedt ) . \nwhat is just as snicker-worthy is how this co-venture between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high-profile corporate collaboration , microsoft and nbc\'s cable news network msnbc , which employs jenny , who is the film\'s ostensible main character . \nin the vision of america presented here , msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home , when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country . \nthe initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante\'s peak , but there\'s one thing about deep impact i underestimated : the skills of director mimi leder . \nshe won an emmy for her helming work on nbc\'s smash er , which is essentially a weekly disaster movie , each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises . \nthe challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold : ( 1 ) to make the audience care for these guest characters , regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are , and ( 2 ) powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy-handed or overly melodramatic . \nhaving passed the "" er challenge "" in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker , leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin\'s rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen . \nas the countdown to impact progresses , the ominous feeling of doom is palpable , leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and affecting emotional dimension . \nthere\'s nothing here that will profoundly move anyone , but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects . \nsituations that initially feel contrived , such as jenny\'s familial crisis and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) and comet discoverer leo biederman ( elijah wood ) , achieve some poignance ; and even the more vaguely drawn characters , including u . s . president tom beck ( morgan freeman ) , astronaut spurgeon "" fish "" tanner ( robert duvall ) , and his rather faceless crew ( ron eldard , jon favreau , mary mccormack , blair underwood , and alexander baluyev ) aboard the comet-bombing spacecraft messiah , have their share of touching moments . \nthe latter fact owes a debt to the actors , who all do a solid job and are well-cast , with the possible exception of leoni ; she delivers a decent performance , but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster . \nalthough its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work ( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular ) place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister , it is the first of the \'90s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true--a film that makes a genuine impact , even if it isn\'t as deep as hoped . \n'"
0,"b'for a movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones , it is surprising to find the messenger : the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess . \nin the early to mid 1400\'s , there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman . \nthe church was a dismally dark and oppressive place . \nfrance was involved in "" the hundred years war "" against england . \nthere was no strong political leadership in the country . \nmorale was low , there being little hope for the future . \nit was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing "" voices "" and seeing "" visions . "" \nconvinced that these were messages from god , she brazenly demanded to see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him . \nthe message : if he would give her an army to command , she would deliver to him the crown . \nhe does . . . \nand she does . \nthen , once seated on the throne , he abandons her to her english captors . \ndirector luc besson ( the fifth element ) may have co-wrote the script but he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material . \nthe inconsistencies of the cast , the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes , the inappropriate musical score , and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable . \nhis biggest miscue was to cast his wife , milla jovovich ( the fifth element ) in the title role . \nms . jovovich , looks spectacular as joan , clad in battle armor , astride a similarly protected horse . \nif looks were enough to fully convey a character , she would have been brilliant . \nsince it isn\'t , she tried ( and failed ) to act the part . \nher joan is unbalanced , "" inspiring "" the troops merely by screaming stridently and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed . \njohn malkovich ( being john malkovich ) fares a bit better as the dauphin , who joan would see on the throne as charles vii . \nan easily manipulated man , his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death . \nfaye dunaway ( the thomas crown affair ) gives a strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphin\'s mother-in-law and chief advisor . \nthe army under joan\'s command are comprised of comical figures , more stooges than soldiers . \nthe one exception would be tcheky karyo ( la femme nikita ) as dunois , the man who was leading the attack prior to joan\'s arrival . \ntrying to plan a systematic campaign , he sees his leadership authority negated by joan\'s insistence on following her "" visions .

0,"b'you know , i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man . \nwhile watching instinct , i couldn\'t help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well-explored themes of those earlier movies . \neven beside the tarzan comparison , instinct just isn\'t a very good film . \nit\'s painfully idealistic , manipulative , and silly . \ni didn\'t hate it -- it\'s simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore , most of the acting is quite good . \nbut i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved . \ni can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct , and it\'s pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams . \nthings start off in the predictable way , as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero , theo caulder ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , an ambitious , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced , old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland ) . \ncaulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life , the one he thinks will make him famous . \nthe subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years . \npowell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa , and it\'s now caulder\'s job to find out of he\'s mentally competent enough to stand trial . \nthrough a series of short sessions , caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell . \neven though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting . \nas i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he\'s on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he\'s not acting , that he\'s actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas . \nthe character himself isn\'t very interesting -- he\'s just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action . \ngooding jr . does strong work opposite hopkins , playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual . \nthe screenplay , written by gerald di pego and "" suggested by "" a novel by daniel quinn , gives us no background information on caulder , but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he\'s obsessed with his work ) . \nnonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct . \nunfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting . \nturtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct\'s artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live , and they do so by means of brainless subplots . \nfirst , we have the prison warden subplot . \nthe prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder\'s progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case , then that\'s fine . \nthere\'s also the prison guard subplot . \nthe prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision , and he\'s instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion . \nthen there\'s the daughter subplot , in which maura tierney ( playing the daughter ) must look very upset a lot of the time ; after all , she is the daughter of a deranged man . \nif some of this stuff sounds familiar , that\'s because they\'re all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films . \nthe evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here . \nthe offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo\'s nest had . \nashton\'s evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown\'s in the shawshank redemption . \nhopkins\' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs . \nand then there\'s the whole tarzan thing , which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film . \nperhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth . \nthe message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are "" takers , "" that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas . \ni can sympathize with that , but only when it\'s in a compelling film . \nthis is the kind of stupid movie -- just like patch adams -- in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates , in this case ) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards . \nwhat does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas ? \nif all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor , we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior to the two-hour one that i watched today . \nif the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise , then we would really have had something interesting -- a movie that doesn\'t rely on the strength of its actors . \n'"

"" \nnot only that , the environmental protection agency is on dwayne\'s ass over a building development project . \nit\'s enough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdown--that is , if he doesn\'t succeed in blowing his brains out first . \nmeanwhile , midland city is about to host a fine arts festival , and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout ( albert finney ) , a writer who is far from the renowned author the festival\'s organizer ( buck henry ) was led to believe--in fact , he\'s a penniless hack who writes second-rate sci-fi that appears in porn magazines . \nhis trek to midland city is also a spiritual journey , one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne , who for some reason thinks that trout will hold for him all of life\'s answers . \nthe above is already a longer plot synopsis than i usually give in my reviews , but , ironically , i have barely scratched the surface . \ni haven\'t yet mentioned wayne hoobler ( omar epps ) , an ex-con with an obsessive admiration for the similarly-named dwayne . \nthen there\'s the matter of francine ( glenne headly ) , dwayne\'s devoted secretary . \nnot to mention dwayne\'s employee and old friend harry lesabre ( nolte ) , the one with the secret penchant for cross-dressing . \nand so on . \nthe film is essentially dwayne\'s story , but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what the point is . \nrudolph does arrive at a point ( more on that later ) , but it\'s blunted and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material . \nthe surreal visual style , complete with printed words flying through the air and into dwayne\'s ears , is obviously meant to convey a sense of madness , but its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad . \nthe actors are called on to act accordingly , resulting in some of the worst , most overdone work all of them have ever turned in . \nwillis fares best of all--but that\'s because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audience . \nwith such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running time , it comes as a shock when things suddenly turn serious , and rudolph tries to make a statement . \nunlike _american_beauty_ ( a film that _breakfast_ resembles in more than a few ways , to its great detriment ) , there isn\'t any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the audience for the big shift . \nas such , the cartoony characters fail to win a sympathy that needs to be earned ; and the film attempts , to no avail , to reach a profundity that it doesn\'t deserve . \nvonnegut\'s original novel is considered a classic , but it had been called unfilmable--the same that was said of hunter s . thompson\'s _fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas_ , which was disastrously committed to film last year by terry gilliam . \nwith the similar failure of _breakfast_of_champions_ , will hollywood ever learn that books labeled "" unfilmable "" inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable ? \nlikely not . \n'"
1,"b'david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head . \nit is one of many science fiction films , released during the last year of this millenium , that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future . \nthe story unfolds in a near future , where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs . \nthe world of the future is an unfriendly place , where the scared inhabitants are "" hiding "" in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world . \nallegra geller ( jennifer jason leigh ) , the leading game designer in the world , is testing her new virtual reality game , existenz with a focus group . \nas they begin , she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun . \nshe flees with a young marketing trainee , ted pikul ( jude law ) , who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard . \nunfortunately , her pod , an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program , is damaged . \nto inspect it , she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her . \nthe events leading up to this , and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn\'t exist , as the "" players "" are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot . \nhere the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game\'s perspective . \ni don\'t intend to reveal more of the film\'s premise , which is structured as a computer game , with "" tasks "" that the characters must complete to win the game . \nreleased after "" the matrix "" and "" dark city "" , "" existenz "" has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films . \nhowever , "" existenz "" is moving in a different direction , with a premise of its own . \na combination of dazzling special effects , brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot , made "" the matrix "" a rare and entertaining science fiction experience , with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade . \n "" existenz "" has a completely different atmosphere , resembling "" dark city "" , which is darker , more serious and less entertaining . \n "" existenz "" has the opportunities and potential , but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored . \nafter the engaging beginning , it starts to falter . \nwhile i was watching the film , many left the theatre during the first hour . \nand indeed , "" existenz "" seemed as a complete failure : the actors seemed unreal , the plot and dialogue silly , unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another . \nbut the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete different level , explaining all past events , the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within a few scenes . \nand jet the film fails on several issues . \nprobably the best written character in the story is a game designer , who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world , than face real life . \nthis is a great possibility to create a magnificent character , and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg\'s script to the limits , but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown . \nexistenz is not a world of which you might dream about in your fantasies . \nit is not a world worth sacrificing your life for . \nit\'s a cold , dark place where the "" players "" are forced to interrelate with unreal characters , eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will . \nit doesn\'t look like a place worth even thinking about . \ndavid cronenberg has been the creator of "" the fly "" , "" videodrome "" and "" the dead zone "" , so it\'s not so hard to guess that "" existenz "" is a violent and gory film . \nbesides the regular murders of innocent people , the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a two-headed mutated amfibium . \nscenes like that have become a trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he can\'t make a film without flowing blood and foul creatures . \nthe way i see it , this is the film\'s crucial failure . \nit is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time , space and problems of our everyday life do not exist ; a place of blooming blossoms , green forests and clear waters ; a place really worth sacrificing your life for . \nbecause of its lack of three dimensionality , the film looses most of its possibilities , but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes , amusing performances ( especially by willem dafoe ) and one interesting and important thought , depicted in many different ways throughout the movie . \nduring the film , the audience is as confused as the characters : detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created . \n "" the matrix "" , despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts , ends with a light at the end of the tunnel . \n "" existenz "" does not . \nit is a one time experience , ending in blood , gore and madness - a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow . \n'"
0,"b'pre-review note : seeing as the only concern of body shots is "" sex "" , i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review . \nbecause of this , i will try to vary word descriptions of "" sex "" ( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms , and \\ or your name is jerry falwell , you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen ) , so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend , fret not , it\'s most likely just another way of referring to "" sex "" . \ni think we\'d all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review . \nthough not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what . \nbody shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously , in the way you\'d normally expect to see a violent attack . \nit\'s about people who think about screwing , seek it out , and talk about it . \nthese are things we all do , sometimes . \nthe characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts . \ntheir lives center around the next sexual encounter , but they seemed depressed . \nit\'s as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek . \nat its core body shots is a message movie , the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition . \nmichael cristoffer ( who directed gia , another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil ) is a moralist with nothing new to say . \nhis characters don\'t communicate anything of interest to each other , so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera . \nthey voice simplistic platitudes like "" i like to come "" or "" sex without love equals violence "" . \nhuh ? \nand yes that is as complex as this movie\'s observations get . \nthe characters are stupid and shallow , with not one registering as anything more . \nthe plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure , then the after math ( the morning after ) of such events . \nwe meet the characters as they speak directly to us , confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy . \ni would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them , giving you the pros and cons , but for this film i cannot . \ni\'m not trying to be clever or witty , but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others . \nwith the exception of trent ( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman ) , the rest fade into each other-- a patchwork of fake breasts , defined abs , pearly white teeth , and creamy , flawless skin . \ni vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one , only because his character gets the worst lines ( "" sex without love equals violence "" ) . \nin between all the confessionals , cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial , with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning . \nthe fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me . \nthis film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining . \nif body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f * * k-obsessed , fine , i don\'t have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way , but cristoffer only gives us one side . \nadditionally that one side isn\'t even entertaining ; the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness . \nor realism . \none sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters . \nthey suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason ( other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ? ? ? alas , if it could only be that easy ? ? ? kidding of course ) , then , not only isn\'t it erotic , it isn\'t real . \nit doesn\'t feel like an authentic sexual encounter . \nevery f * * k scene in this film ( and there are many ) is treated in the same unsexy manner . \nbody shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film . \nit shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it , and most of all , it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it . \nthe resulting search for nookie ( and you can take that cookie ? ? ? ) over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow . \nthe main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred . \nthe film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off . \nthis is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently , and if memory serves me i can\'t think of one film that has done so , and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80\'s next to wall street . \nunfortunately nobody gives us reason to care , not the writer , the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off . \npaul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here , though boogie nights succeeded . \nit was similarly moralistic , but it gave us two different viewpoints ; it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters , and it showed us the possible fall-out of such a decision . \nthe characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here , but anderson seemed to care about them . \nhe gave them heart . \ncristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones . \nhe preaches to us , by using his characters to preach to us . \nthis is not the way to get any message across . \nwhy not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin\' skins ? \ncristofer kind of does that , though without an ounce of insight , and with a helping of leering exploitation . \n'"
1,"b'bob the happy bastard\'s quickie review : \nrush hour \nso what\'s the problem with 48 hours clones these days ? \nthey always try for the same thing that eddie murphy and nick nolte had . \nthat was the problem that plagued these clones , not to mention the actual sequel : another 48 hours , a complete waste of film . \nbut , at last , someone has a different take on the matter , and it\'s director brett rainer . \nrush hour features jackie chan in his first u . s . action movie , playing a chinese detective who\'s being flown to the us to investigate the kidnapping of the chinese consulate\'s daughter . \nof course , the fbi is upset that he\'ll be interfering in their investigation , and stick him with an lapd office with a big mouth- of course , that\'s chris tucker . \nwhat makes rush hour work so damn well is the chemistry between the energetic chan and the absolutely hilarious tucker . \ntucker mouths off to chan at every given opportunity ( "" i\'m michael jackson , you tito .

0,"b'there isn\'t much good about this movie . \nnot much i can say about the acting , directing , or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie . \nso i\'ll get my one good comment out of the way , at least joel schuemacher ( batman & robin ) didn\'t direct it or it would be titled "" technicolor city "" . \nin fact there is nothing colorful about this movie , its dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end . \nthe plot has a tendency to be interesting , but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been a fascinating movie . \nthe plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets , so i will just touch on the bare minimum . \njohn murdoch ( rufus sewell ) awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel , only to find out he has forgotten everything . \njohn must find out who he is before the "" strangers "" ( a . k . a . \nmind erasing aliens ) find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy . \nduring the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality , and the existence of inherently evil people . \nany of these points however are completely "" erased "" from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script . \nas i mentioned earlier , nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film . \nthe acting is bland , and since there is virtually no character development no one seems to care . \nthe special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake , a sign of a true "" b-movie "" . \nthe direction is poor and there is little continuity , not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly . \nlastly the script is weak and has no concept of reality , and doesn\'t deserve to have the word "" science "" in science-fiction . \nif i haven\'t got my point across , i\'ll say it more plainly : this is a bad movie . \nlets hope the next movie by alex "" i wish i was tim burton "" proyas is at least tolerable . \n'"
0,"b'i can\'t recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota . \nfor forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt . \nthen , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another . \nfeeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face . \nfeeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him . \nred\'s punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d\'onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie\'s dreams . \nenter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam\'s estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie\'s eye and have sex with her in the bathroom . \nunited in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn\'t ready to let them go without a fight . \nfreddie , meanwhile , isn\'t ready to let sam\'s money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations . \nthere is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam\'s intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father . \nit does a great job of setting up jjaks\' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves\' wounded look is just right for jjaks . \nthe wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin . \nmost important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements\' "" i will dare "" on the car radio . \nyou would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota . \nunfortunately , you would be dead wrong . \ni suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn\'t expect what i got . \nwhat i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality . \nsuddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable . \nthe sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations . \nvincent d\'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood . \nthere are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme\'s something wild and neil jordan\'s the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn\'t try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment . \ni don\'t want to dismiss baigelman\'s successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper . \nit _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can\'t make his two halves into a whole . \nfeeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there\'s not much funny about that . \n'"

1,"b'when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time . \nwhile i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good . \ni\'m happy to say that there\'s something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs . \nin fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours . \nthe film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island . \nted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can\'t seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w . \nearl brown ) , who\'s being harassed by one of the school jocks . \nit seems warren\'s sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted\'s willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up . \nmary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom . \nted was just flattered that she even knew his name . \nunfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital . \nfast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn\'t seen since that fateful day . \nwith the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love . \nhowever , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections . \nthere\'s something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin . \nnot exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them . \nwith their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you\'ll not only enjoy , but also won\'t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler . \nthe film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers\' last two films ) they almost all work . \ni have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on . \none minute you\'ll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you\'ll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary\'s apartment . \none of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller . \nhe is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he\'s a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation . \nted\'s a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don\'t always work out . \nit\'s comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top . \nactually , i\'ve liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties . \nthe film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money . \nin it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler . \nit was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived "" the ben stiller show "" on the fox network in late \'92/early \'93 . \nlike "" the critic "" ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show\'s cancellation . \ncameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times . \nhowever , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she\'s got guys just falling over each other to be with her . \nheck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week . \nmy girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn\'t change , and you know , it\'s really true . \nhe and ralph macchio must hang out or something . \nmaybe they live in dick clark\'s pool house . \nanyway , here\'s another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary\'s heart . \nthe supporting performances are also good . \nchris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy . \nlin shae , who plays mary\'s neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film . \nlee evans , as mary\'s friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist . \nthe farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren\'t any noticeable times where the film drags . \nthe only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes . \nthey appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera . \nit\'s a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film . \nafter that it got a little annoying , and it\'s unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow . \nfortunately , filled with sight gags , humorous lines , and solid comedic acting , there\'s something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater . \n'"
1,"b'city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking , moving , and completely unsentimental . \ni find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant , which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality . \ncity of angels is a wonderful film , enhanced by interesting and well-rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years . \nit\'s a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story , and avoids most of the cliches we\'re so used to seeing in films like this . \ncity of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders\' 1988 film wings of desire . \ni have yet to see wings of desire , so i am , unfortunately , unable to make a comparison of the two . \ni have heard , however , that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways , which makes me glad that this film isn\'t a rip-off of its source material . \nnicolas cage stars as seth , an angel who , like all of his angel counterparts , is present to lead the dying to heaven ( or somewhere just like it ) . \none day , he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr . maggie rice ( meg ryan ) , and his attention is called to her . \nthe angels can make themselves seen to humans , but they can\'t experience any of the senses ( most importantly , touch ) . \nhe shows himself to maggie , and she falls for him , unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status . \nseth wants to become human so he can feel her . \nthat\'s when he meets nathaniel messinger ( dennis franz ) , "" former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race . "" \n ( as a side note , i found messinger to be the most fascinating character , for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death . ) \nmessinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human . \nseth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know , it sounds ridiculous , but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well-done ) ; after much deliberation , she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel . \nthis , of course , is when seth decides to take the plunge ( literally ) from a building ; when he wakes up from the fall , he is human , and happy to feel what it\'s like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead . \nsince i love this film so much , i\'ll make a minor note that it certainly isn\'t perfect . \nalthough it is original and mesmerizing , it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre . \nthe plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic ( though the details are what make the story excellent , and steel has done a great job with them ) . \nthe ending , too , could have been more powerful and less predictable . \nthese elements are minor , though , and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels . \nthe acting is superb from everyone involved . \nthis is perhaps my second-favorite performance from cage ( my favorite being the rock ) . \nhe\'s quiet and pensive , and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly-toned words . \nhe\'s perfect for a role like this , and at the same time he reassures us he\'s not bound by playing the psycho ( though he is good at it , as he shows in face/off ) . \nmeg ryan is a powerful , enticing , and appealingly-chirpy actress , and her work here is some of her best . \ndennis franz , however , steals all of his scenes as the energetic former-angel . \nwhat i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation . \ndirector brad silberling is a talented man , and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters , rather than forced sentimentality . \nhis direction is steady , and he shows this in just about every scene : near the beginning , maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead . \nthere is no music or elaborate camera work ; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information . \nthis is the way stories should be told , and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real . \nthe film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do . \ncinematographer john seale ( the english patient ) provides some of the most stunning images i\'ve seen on the big screen : hundreds of black-clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours ( just as an example ) . \nthe music , by gabriel yared ( also of the english patient ) , is perfect for this film : it\'s quiet and moody music ( but not sentimental ! ) , and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely . \nthe visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far . \nall of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre . \nit\'s a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across--the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously . \n'"
0,"b' "" spice world "" is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls . \nsure there\'s a hint of humor in there every once in a while . \nactually , there\'s a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls . \nbut overall , who cares ? \nnot me . \nif you don\'t know by now , the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power , yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood . \nin "" spice world "" they ride around in their big tour bus , whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews . \namazingly , all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things , things they want to do , not things they are required to do to keep earning money . \nand they keep babbling about "" girl power "" when they should really be talking about "" cleavage power "" . \ni mean , if all it takes is girl power , then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits ? \nthe film is pg , but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions , you\'d have yourself one raunchy adult film . \nby the way , there\'s something in the opening credits which says "" based on an idea by the spice girls "" . \nwow , they got idea credit ! \ni certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood . . . \ngiving credit for simply having the thought "" say girls , let\'s make a movie ! "" \nthe supporting cast fares well . \nroger moore ( the real james bond ) mockingly plays the cliche-spewing "" chief "" of the spice girls , and darn it all , he\'s fun to watch . \nmark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the band\'s manager ( richard e . grant ) . \none question though : george wendt ? \nyou\'d think that "" spice world "" would envoke one of two reactions in people . \nif you like the spice girls , you\'ll like them even more afterwards . \nand if you can\'t stand them ( like me ) , then "" spice world "" will really make you sick . \noddly , the audience i saw the film with , roughly 50 twelve year-old girls , sat in silence for the entire film . \nwell , not the two who sat directly behind me . \nthey kept muttering "" this is stupid "" over and over again . \nmaybe there is hope for humanity after all . \n[pg] \n'"
0,"b'kate ( jennifer aniston ) is having some problems . \nit appears the twenty-eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the company ladder , and her love life apparently leaves something to be desired . \nshe learns that her problems are related , as the owner of her advertising agency , mr . mercer ( kevin dunn ) , explains to her that her single status does not bode well with the company . \nher freedom would make her more likely to leave the company , taking clients with her . \na solution presents itself in nick ( jay mohr ) , a wedding videographer who kate meets through a coincidence and gets photographed with . \nkate\'s boss , darcy ( illeana douglas ) , uses the photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between kate and nick . \nkate is at first repulsed by the idea , but after getting immediate positive results , she pursues it . \nher first task is to convince nick to go along with her plan . \nthe actual plan consists of nick pretending to be her fianc ? . \nat a dinner with kate\'s bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break up . \nshe meets nick to propose the plan . \nhe accepts . \nkate\'s new status brings unexpected results in other areas . \nthe office bad boy , sam ( kevin bacon ) , who wouldn\'t give kate the time of day , now does . \nnow that she is engaged , he pursues an affair with her , as doing so would destroy her good girl image , hence sam\'s sudden interest . \nthings start to fall apart for kate , as it becomes apparent that nick really likes her , and does not wish to break up with her . \nafter some provoking nick does oblige , but problems continue for kate . \nit appears sam is no longer interested now that she is available . \nor maybe kate does like nick , but "" reconciliation "" will force her to admit her lies to her employer . \nadding to her mess is the constant prying of her mother ( olympia dukakis ) , who wants her to get married and settle down . \nthere is a scene in this movie where jennifer aniston is ( from the waist up ) only wearing a bra . \nit made me chuckle because it is the only time in the movie when she actually wears one . \nthere is enough cleavage in this movie to satisfy russ meyer . \nit\'s like the director said \'well , we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren\'t that great so , what the heck , let\'s show jennifer\'s assets as often and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the pg rating . "" \nquite frankly it\'s insulting . \ni don\'t think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie . \nshe did a decent enough job in ed burns\' "" she\'s the one "" because it was a smaller and supporting role , and she just doesn\'t deliver the goods effectively in this movie . \nher performance was not convincing . \nunfortunately , as far as romantic comedies go , this movie adds nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies . \nthe film is similar to "" my best friends wedding "" in a sense that the leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her actions , gets no sympathy from me when things go awry . \ni didn\'t care for how quickly kate puts down nick\'s profession by explaining that videotaping weddings wasn\'t glamorous enough for her co-workers . \nat least "" my best friends wedding "" changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending . \nno such luck with "" picture perfect "" . \nevery plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away , including a couple that really made no sense . \nafter everything kate had done to prove her loyalty to her company , why would she blindly throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first , let alone consider a relationship ? \nwas quitting her job a prerequisite to making amends with nick ? \nthrow in the fact that i don\'t think nick and kate spent enough time together to even warrant that rash of a decision . \ni believe that kate liked him , but liked him so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away ? \ni doubt it . \nand what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the couple ? \nare mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers ? \nwell , i guess of the congregation consists of movie extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars , then that would make sense . \npicture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron \nkate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . jennifer aniston nick . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . jay \nmohr sam . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . kevin \nbacon mercer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . kevin \ndunn darcy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . illeana \ndouglas rita . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . olympia \ndukakis \nwritten by randy turgeon , february 26 , 1998 . \nvisit my movie reviews ! \nwww . xtdl . com/~canran \n'"
0,"b'brian de palma , the director who bought us carrie , dressed to kill and mission : impossible is back , and has bought all his technical expertise with him . \nsadly , he forget to bring a good story and believable characters . \nnic cage plays rick santaro , a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne ( sinise . ) \nan assassination takes place , and santaro tries to peace together how it took place , trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy . \nthe film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together . \nhowever , the film doesn\'t keep the mystery for long , and once the big \'secret\' is out concerning kevin dunne , the film is at a dead end . \nalthough there are some fantastic shots by de palma , including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film , halfway through the film drops dead . \nthe problem is that de palma doesn\'t have a strong story or characters to work with . \nhe tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques , but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience , and i quickly got bored . \nnic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters , but it\'s no use . \nthey are boring , faceless , and completely unlikeable . \nyes , another problem with the film is that there\'s no-one to root for . \nwe\'re supposed to be on cage\'s side , because his character becomes nicer throughout the film . \nhowever , his change is sadly unbelievable . \npoor gary sinise\'s character is terrible , who completely changes throughout the start , the middle and the end , in an appalling way . \nthe film\'s use of flashback quickly gets boring . \nwhile clever and interesting the first few times , it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go . \nthey certainly don\'t increase the tension or suspense of the movie . \nthere is small thread of suspense running through the film , but it certainly doesn\'t make this film a powerhouse thriller , rather just a slightly below average one . \nthe script is lousy and contrived , the characters flat and two dimensional . \ncertainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller . \nthe most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential . \nthere\'s a good story buried in snake eyes , it\'s just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks . \nit also gives itself away far too quickly , rather than leaving the big twist for the end . \nwhile the performances are intriguing , especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy \'number cruncher\' wrapped up in the case , there\'s no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance , and unless you\'re a big fan of either cage or flash directing , should be avoided . \na david wilcock review ? 1998 \n "" you know , for kids "" - norville barnes \n'"
1,"b'it\'s tough to really say something nice about a type of person who\'s so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone , but by god , "" american history x "" does it , and for that , i commend it . \nit not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who\'s not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off . \nthe subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack . \nhe\'s the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks . \nhe\'s so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process . \nhis name is derek vinyard , and he\'s played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he\'s almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x . when we first see him , he\'s clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he\'s attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn\'t need them . \nhe so believes in his convictions that he\'s willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years . \n "" american history x "" is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake . \nwe see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he\'s done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides . \nor at least , that\'s the intention . \nthe film\'s framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek\'s deep space 9 ) , is trying to "" correct "" him . \nwhen the film opens , danny has just written a book report on "" mein kampf , "" landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek\'s life and how it has gotten him nowhere . \ncoincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he\'s cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair . \nhe\'s just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he\'s wisened up . \nhe\'s no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who\'s becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle . \nbut danny won\'t . \nhe goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago . \nthe film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white . \nwe mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on . \nto them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them . \nand frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true . \n "" american history x "" is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next . \nin it , there are some of the best scenes i\'ve seen all year . \none scene features a dinner between derek\'s family , and his mother\'s newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek\'s rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould\'s reaction to derek\'s final summation is unnerrving ) . \nanother scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison . \nand another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year . \nthere\'s much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d\'angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he\'s given in what seems like a really long time ) . \nnorton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble . \nin only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best . \nthere\'s nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando . \nthat he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing . \nsadly enough , this isn\'t going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be . \nit\'s too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece . \nthe ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon . \nsome of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the "" fat skinhead , "" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn\'t as well travelled . \nfurlong\'s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn\'t seem like it has actually arrived there . \neven derek\'s descent into skinhead-dom doesn\'t seem justified . \nthough his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from "" boy meets world , "" and don\'t ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs . \nas such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed . \nsorta . \n "" american history x "" is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential . \nsomewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus . \nalthough he aimed for the directing credit to go to "" alan smithee , "" the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director , it wasn\'t allowed to him , under the grounds that once you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but really , that\'s the macguffin - no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval ) . \nkaye\'s right in that it\'s not up to par , even if he\'s not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par . \nthis will not be a "" do the right thing "" for the late 90s . \nyet it still gets its point across intelligently , and backs it up with its story ( its message , that one cannot be so enwrapped in one\'s own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur , is literally said over the narration , unfortunately ) . \nand even if it isn\'t perfect , at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison , and asks him if anything he\'s done has made his life any better , it realy hits a nerve , not only in derek , but also in the audience . \n'"
0,"b""don't let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare . \nno one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work , and this movie makes a vain attempt at that . \nany moves to ? glamorise' his life , which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do , will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness . \nthis movie about his life , although well written , puts too much make-up on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes , rather than lobster and champagne . \noh well , let's fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious play-write , who falls in love with a beautiful woman ( gwyneth paltrow ) and from her inspiration , several plays develop - ? romeo and juliet' , and ? the twelfth night' . \nit is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream and that's how all his plays develop , but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama . \nbut i guess my version probably wouldn't draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen . \nso is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare , when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul . \ni think not . \nas for the oscars were they deserved by this movie ? \ni think not . \nin many aspects ? private ryan' and ? life is beautiful' were far superior movies , but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar , as time and again , for reasons unexplained , an undeserving movie will win the accolade . \nanother sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead , over a more polished cate , but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised - people will start feeling sorry for you . \n"""

1,"b'1992\'s alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979\'s alien and 1986\'s aliens , savaged david fincher\'s slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . \nhence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap . \ndespite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . \nwriter joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film . \nthat done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her . \nalien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death . \nwhat could be next ? \nwhedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also "" infected "" with alien dna . \nso the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude . \nunfortunately , that is where alien resurrection\'s clever streak in writing stops . \nthe alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features . \nbut the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought . \nthe movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them . \nand the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy . \nwhile the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon . \nthe alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . \nthe violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence . \nthe film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji . \nas technically adept as jeunet\'s direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon\'s ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series . \na sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . \nno , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott\'s alien or the even greater film that james cameron\'s aliens was . \nbut after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher\'s alien3 , jeunet\'s resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride . \nthat is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments . \n'"

"" \n "" mouse hunt "" is a pretty dark movie -- even some of the humor can be grim -- but it\'s hardly ever mean-spirited . \nthe star of the show is neither the top-billed lane nor the titular mouse . \nit\'s lanky british comedian evans , whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned-up jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill ( note a toned-down but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease ) ; evans\' banter with the ever-affable lane is funny stuff , too , and holds its own against the movie\'s more flashy physical shtick . \nvicki lewis ( beth from "" newsradio "" ) is solid in a supporting role as lars\' money-grubbing wife . \nand in a nifty bit of novelty casting , christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously , popping a dropping into his mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a "" calcium deficiency . "" \nblech . \na basically one-joke idea -- a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans -- is given a rather engaging execution . \ntheir sparring is imaginatively realized ( i don\'t think i\'ll ever forget the sight of that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda ) , and although you really never fully root for either side , that\'s okay -- a warm-and-fuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from the first frame they share . \n "" mouse hunt "" may take a while to get going ( the rather lengthy set-up could test the patience of some of the younger children , although i rather liked it , much in part to lane and evans ) , and the climactic sequence is allowed to play out for a bit too long , but this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable , not unlike the original "" home alone .

s are also the order of the day with mission to mars . \ndialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style ( even independence day , which lifted all of it\'s premises from other sci-fi films was better than this film , and i don\'t like independence day ) . \nfilms like 2001 : a space odyssey , the abyss , and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from ( and poorly at that ) . \nthere is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon , and i couldn\'t help but whisper "" u\'tinni "" to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it . \nthis film also features one of my all-time least favorite movie clich ? s : the "" he would have wanted you to have this "" moment , where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having ( and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on ) . \nscenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films , but in a film as clich ? ridden as this , it is particularly irritating . \nennio morricone\'s music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on , but here it is dreadfully overbearing . \nhis music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes . \nat other times his music is unbearably over-dramatic . \none sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won\'t reach its intended target . \nmission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme . \nevents are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience . \nwe are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife , but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest . \nwhat makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins\' character needs to turn himself into a popsicle , except to invoke an emotional response ( i could think of at least one way to save him , and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be "" smarter "" than i am ) . \nduring the finale , when we are finally introduced to the translucent , conehead , kitty-faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from , we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film ( just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn ) . \na brief history lesson about "" where we came from "" is proffered , then sinise is whisked away to be with "" the rest of our people "" ( he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that "" this is a chance to step foot where no one else has "" ) . \n>from the press i\'ve been seeing this film receive , it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying a quick death at the theater . \ni\'m sure the first weekend or two will be huge , but once word gets out people will stop going . \nlet\'s just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and isn\'t hurt by the negativity this film is generating . \ni\'d venture to say it won\'t be worse than this waste of time . \n[pg] \n'"
0,"b'it should have been a classic . \na great cast of respected supporting actors . \nan interesting premise of loser comic book characters . \nhowever , "" mystery men "" proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999 . \nthe jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals . \nthe number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise . \nthe script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laugh-out-loud joke and mediocre small jokes , it failed miserably at being entertaining at all . \nthe jokes were not funny for a number of reasons . \nthey had been used a number of times before in previous films , the best ones , which were mediocre to begin with , were ruined in the trailer , and the expectation of laughing at clever , unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film . \n "" mystery men "" might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business . \nbut with veterans doing this kind of junk , it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought . \nthankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie . \nthe film follows a band of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy . \nthe fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero , captain amazing , who has recently captured every evil-doer in the city . \ncaptain amazing ( played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear ) , because of his success in the past , is worried that he will lose popularity . \nafter freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city ( geoffrey rush , overacting just a bit too much ) to keep himself busy , things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured . \nit is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day . \nby the time this section of the plot is finished , the interest for what happens ( if you haven\'t already figured it out ) is very low . \nthere are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention . \nthe first scene in the film , which shows the wannabes trying to save the day , feels like it was seriously edited down . \nright when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folk\'s home by some masked goons , captain amazing comes in and saves the day ? or ruins the movie . \ninstead of editing this scene , more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and monica , a waitress ( claire forlani ) or the vast majority of the film , which is the heroes talking at a coffee table about how their day was . \na simple rule : more silly action is needed in order to make a silly action movie work . \nanother major problem with "" mystery men "" is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances . \nthe film depended on its cast to work fluently together , like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion . \nhowever , most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way . \nto pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of a hat , paul reubens , who disappeared from acting to everyone\'s joy , returns here leaving very little to be impressed about . \nas a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon , all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes . \nfart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of "" american pie "" and "" there\'s something about mary .

1,"b'the most amazing thing about paul cox\'s innocence is how unlike a movie it is . \ni mean that as the highest compliment . \nif most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance , i\'d want to run and hide . \nthe sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters\' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence . \nalong with a charming romantic story , the australian/belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable . \nthe romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles "" bud "" tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby . \nthey decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair . \ncomplicating matters is andreas\' frail health , and claire\'s longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can\'t understand why he\'s suddenly become obsolete . \nin my mind , the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire , than the feelings of everyone involved . \njohn , claire\'s husband , endlessly questions what he did wrong . \nclaire initially insists she\'s a grown-up , but admittedly behaves like a child , a prospect that thrills and disappoints her . \nandreas , an agnostic , begins to question his fate , a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence . \ncox litters the movie with flashbacks , including the repeated vision of a roaring train . \nit\'s a reminder of andreas and claire\'s past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed . \na pall is cast on the whole affair . \na master of the understated , cox strings together a series of memorable moments . \nin andreas\' dream sequence , amidst the roar of the train and conversations , we get the whole picture of andreas and claire\'s love . \nwe also get glimpses into john and claire\'s relationship . \nduring a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward , claire admits to john about her indiscretion , telling more than any monologue could . \nall that\'s heard is the scraping of forks against plates . \nthe characters are unlike anything i\'ve seen -- they\'re people . \nso many times , movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky . \nor they\'re reduced to comedic buffoons . \nordinary people with a pile of emotions , claire and andreas aren\'t sure what the next step is . \nthey do want to be happy , which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they\'ve known throughout their adult lives . \nbravo to cox , who wrote the script , for not making john a monster , so that claire\'s affair is automatically justified . \nnorris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire\'s love difficult to accept . \nwe feel for him . \nhe\'s a decent man . \nsure , he may have become complacent , but he never expected this , especially now . \nwith so much presented to the audience , it\'s only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive , which it does . \nhowever , in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers , cox displays a skill and ? lan isn\'t likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon . \n'"

"" \nthe replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one-dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography . \nthe story is loosely based around the pro football players\' strike in 1987 and a rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels . \nkeanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has-been football college player looking for redemption . \ngene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers . \nrounding out the cast includes swingers\' jon favreau , 7-up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders . \nthis bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays , gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field , and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny\'s . \nthe usual things happen like clockwork . \nthe hero rises from the ashes of failure , the team comes together in unity , the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest , the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap , and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax . \nit\'s also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks . \nhoward deutch , who was behind the camera for two of the best films of \'80s - pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful , has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes . \nobviously the problem is that without a good script , any director will fail in the end . \nsports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory , gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds , the rise and fall of gallant heroes , and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life . \nthe replacements offers none of this . \n'"
1,"b'people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies . \noften science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller . \nin such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked . \nbut , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic . \nsuch thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman . \nthe mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits . \nbut the right stuff film isn\'t even fiction . \nit was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program . \nthe plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes . \nthe major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier . \nmany pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado . \nbut one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records . \nten years later , soviets have launched "" sputnik "" marking the beginning of the space age . \nin order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space . \nbest air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image . \nin one of critics\' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s . \nsuch high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman\'s film looks quite atypical for its time . \nwith more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life . \nbut the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker . \nphilip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies . \nthe right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking "" artsy "" projects . \nthe right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film . \nthe plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts . \nthe film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece . \nthat gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles . \nsam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty . \non the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases . \nshepard\'s performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn . \nyoung dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward . \nalways reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard . \nkaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots\' wives . \nroyal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch . \ngreat acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman\'s superb direction . \nmost notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time . \nthe beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline . \neverything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world . \nin that setting , it\'s quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights . \nbut the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and "" natural "" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots . \ntheir entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity . \nthis contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , "" mercury "" astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space . \nthose contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman\'s superb use of poetic movie language . \nediting is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) . \nalthough kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights . \nthose effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space . \nanother fine contribution of this film is "" oscar "" -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it . \nit is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy . \nsome of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period . \nthis film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws . \nsome of the "" mercury "" astronauts aren\'t fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) . \nfilm also lacks proper closure . \non the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long . \nalso , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan\'s america . \nin some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s . \ntime has passed ; now we don\'t see astronauts as heroes . \nin this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers . \nfew young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up . \nbut this film , sentimental reminder of the times "" when future began "" , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow "" mercury "" astronauts\' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky . \nand even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema . \n'"

1,"b'jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box-sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well-off . \nmaybe it\'s a classic case of displacement : it\'s easier to see jarvis\' own lyrics ( obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall ) as a fetishization of lowlife , rather than leigh\'s films . \nbut it\'s worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working-class characters don\'t make for a guarantee of \'authenticity\' , let alone a good film . \nit\'s the triumph of secrets & lies , then , that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek \'authenticity\' and honesty in everyday lives . \nfollowing her adopted mother\'s funeral , hortense , a young black optometrist , sets out to find her birth mother , and is disturbed to find out that she is white . \nit is cynthia , a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne . \ncynthia\'s younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages , largely because of his wife\'s animosity towards her . \nhortense calls up cynthia , who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her . \nbut their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually . \ncynthia invites hortense to come along to a party , which maurice is hosting . . . \nsecrets & lies has a simple enough theme at its heart -- as one character puts it , "" best to tell the truth , isn\'t it ? \nthat way nobody gets hurt .

"" \nas played by brenda blethyn , cynthia comes close to being a caricature , with her nervous , somewhat disconnected way of talking . \nbut she\'s really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her , precisely because she\'s so needy of love , perhaps . \nindeed , the whole cast gives warmly rounded , detailed performances . \nthe script was developed partly through improvisations , and the fusion of cast , script and director shows best in the party scene - seemingly everyone is talking at the same time , and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout . \nin a very different way , but also using a long single shot , the scene of hortense and cynthia\'s first meeting in a lonely caf=8a achieves a touching intensity , all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings . \nthe film\'s climax - with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsen-esque revelations , and everybody hugging each other - is the one thing that seems false about this film . \nhowever , it\'s a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the character\'s lives . \nwhen cynthia says near the end , this is the life , innit ? , you get the sense that , following the cynicism of his last film naked , leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all , without comforting illusions . \nthe flying inkpot\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n'"

1,"b'call me crazy , but i don\'t see saving private ryan as the film of the summer . \na good movie , yes , with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare . \nan utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg\'s best work , no . \npersonally , if i was spielberg , i wouldn\'t go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindler\'s list and the indiana jones movies . \ni\'m guessing steve has a thing for nazis ; i really wouldn\'t be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastika-wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie . \nall lofty pretenses aside , saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick . \nthe difference is , it\'s easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacon\'s chest while blood spurts like crazy , but it\'s damn hard to sit and eat reese\'s pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield . \nand believe me , there\'s plenty of it . \na 30-minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain ( tom hanks ) and his soldiers landing at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire . \nlives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on , and all the young men in the audience find themselves never , ever wanting to be drafted . \ncut to some bureaucratic defense office , where a hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the casualties . \none woman happens upon an interesting detail -- three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat , and their mother is getting the telegram today . \ni guess it\'s an interesting conversation piece to everyone but the mother , so the army chief ( harve presnell ) sends hanks on what is essentially a public relations mission , to find the fourth ryan brother and send him home . \nthat way , the army saves the postage on yet another telegram to mrs . ryan . \none good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know it\'s a mission designed to make the army look good . \nthey question the worth of risking eight soldiers\' lives to save one , and hanks\' character admits he doesn\'t give a damn about ryan ; he\'s just following orders . \nif this was a john wayne movie , things would be different . \nthere\'d be a phony , "" let\'s go get that boy , gosh darn it ! "" \nattitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war . \nby doing things this way , spielberg admits the instincts of self- preservation and complacency that every normal person has . \nit makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosterone-driven stallone movie mission . \nthe movie\'s pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semi-introspective conversation among the soldiers . \nhanks is painted first as a nails-tough army man careful to hide his true self from the other men . \nit\'s not that way for long . \nedward burns , the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck isn\'t available , is the impulsive one . \njeremy davies plays the translator who is seeing combat for the first time , and so on . \nnone of the characters are fascinating or natural born heroes , but was spielberg\'s obvious intention . \ni wondered when i heard saving private ryan was three hours long , how were they going to fill three hours\' time searching for one person and still make it interesting ? \nthere are a few false starts ; hanks finds one private ryan in ted danson\'s company ( apparently , danson joined the army after "" ink "" was canceled . ) and breaks the bad news before learning it\'s the wrong ryan . \nand of course the movie\'s far from over when hanks does locate ryan ( matt damon , the other guy you get when affleck isn\'t available ) . \nthat\'s when the movie turns into more of a conventional war flick , although body parts and limbs still fly like never before . \nsaving private ryan is worth your time , but it\'s definitely no schindler\'s list . \nthe battle scenes are intense and realistic , but some of the attempts at sincere emotion aren\'t . \nthe movie\'s bookends are particularly cheesy and out of place , when an old private ryan goes to the cemetary with his family and bawls his eyes out , whining , "" tell me i\'ve led a good life . \ntell me i\'m a good man .

in this fiction can be found much truth . \nthe setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year . \nit\'s so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over . \nthe onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach , giving the terrain an alien appearance . \nit is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured . \nthere are four pairings , and , although there is some interaction between the different twosomes , the winter guest\'s focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship . \nthe first , meatiest pairing is that of elspeth ( phylida law ) and her recently-widowed daughter , frances ( emma thompson ) . \nthese two have a stormy relationship . \nthey love each other deeply , but both are stubborn and willful , and neither is willing to admit that they need the other . \nmuch of their interaction is argumentative , but , during the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline , they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other . \nfrances\' adult son , alex ( gary hollywood ) , is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father . \non this day , he meets a girl , nita ( arlene cockburn ) , who has secretly been spying on him for weeks . \nalthough their first encounter is antagonistic ( she throws a snowball at him ) , both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction . \nonce they retire to a place where they can be alone , however , things don\'t go exactly as planned . \nlily ( sheila reid ) and chloe ( sandra voe ) are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees . \ndeath is a topic of endless fascination for them , perhaps because they are so close to it , and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries , looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area . \nit doesn\'t matter whether or not they knew the deceased . \nit\'s the ceremony that they\'re interested in . \nsam ( douglas murphy ) and tom ( sean biggerstaff ) , a pair of schoolboy chums , are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach , horsing around , building a small fire for warmth , and walking on the frozen water . \nunlike lily and chloe , these two have their entire lives ahead of them . \nthey are young enough to still believe in magic , but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience . \nthe acting is strong and believable . \nthe mixture of veteran performers and first-timers is effective , with the most successful choice being the casting of real-life mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles . \nthere is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different , non-related actors . \nand , of course , the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth and frances as parent and child . \nthe winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995 , with rickman as the director . \nfour of the film\'s principals , phylida law , arlene cockburn , sheila reid , and sandra voe , appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film . \nunlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays , the winter guest has been successfully opened up . \nthe rough , bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans . \nin fact , considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickman\'s microscope , it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie . \nif you appreciate character studies , the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater . \n'"
0,"b'talk about beating a dead horse ! \nwhen home alone was released in 1990 , it was a breath of fresh air , and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely-funny family film . \nthe unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel , so , two years later , we were subjected to home alone 2 , which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited . \nfor john hughes , two home alone movies weren\'t enough ? he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with , including a pathetic box office bomb called baby\'s day out , last year\'s live-action 101 dalmatians , and this year\'s flubber . \nnow , inexplicably , hughes has exhumed not only these worn-out plot elements , but the "" home alone "" name as well . \nthe result ? 1997\'s worst sequel ( edging out speed 2 and batman and robin ) , home alone 3 . \nby changing the characters , hughes ( who wrote and co-produced the film ) , along with his co-conspirator , director raja gosnell , has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest . \nthe new kid , alex pruitt , is played by alex d . linz ( one fine day ) , and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness . \nhe\'s not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was . \nthe villains , pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern , are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber . \nin home alone 3 , there are four of them ( olek krupa , david thornton , lenny von dohlen , and rya kihlstedt ) , but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls . \nthis time , the kid isn\'t left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip . \ninstead , he has developed a bad case of chicken pox , so he can\'t go to school . \nhis dad ( kevin kilner ) is away on business and his mom ( haviland morris ) has to run errands , so , for the most part , he\'s all by himself during the day . \nthrough a series of coincidences too irritating to relate , a top secret u . s . air force integrated circuit comes into his possession . \nit\'s wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex\'s home to retrieve it . \nthe eight- year old , who is wise beyond his years , booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg-type devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains . \nthe movie\'s climax takes place during a raging snowstorm ? only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable . \npreviously , the most counterfeit-looking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii . \nthese are far worse . \nin fact , the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near-blizzard when a shining sun can be seen . \nif it\'s a wonderful life could generate real- looking snow back in the 1940s , why can\'t home alone 3 , which has a significantly larger budget and \'90s technology at its disposal ? \nthere has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live-action cartoon violence for young children . \nhome alone 3 will add fuel to the fire . \nit\'s one thing to see wyle e . coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight , but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen . \nadults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous , but what about five and six-year olds ? \nthe level of violence in home alone 3 is extreme ? many of alex\'s schemes are nasty enough to kill . \nbut , because this is a "" family film , "" no one dies , despite being electrocuted , falling thirty feet , and getting smacked on the head by a barbell . \nnot only is home alone 3 unnecessary , but it\'s offensive . \nit\'s an exercise in tediousness , and there isn\'t a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end ( unless , by some strange quirk of fate , you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes , and thus haven\'t seen this stuff before ) . \ni can\'t imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure . \nmaybe that\'s why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumb-sucking years . \n'"

0,"b'i admit it . \ni thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies . \nwatching him in jingle all the way , i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids . \nit was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg-13 kindergarten cop , but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence , alcohol consumption , burglary , racism and child molestation . \nand you know they\'ll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santa\'s elves . \nhe later decks a reindeer . \nhey , man , why don\'t you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you\'re at it ? \njingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass , it must be funny school of thought . \narnold , sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than a special olympics hockey team , and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene . \nwhat can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents can\'t find a rare toy on christmas eve , and will do anything to get one ? \narnold is , of course , one of the parents , a crack salesman who is never there for his son . \nhe races from the office to his son\'s karate game , only to find out he missed it . \nand his kid distrusts him because he\'s never around . \n ( gee , we haven\'t seen that in a movie before . ) \narnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son\'s affection is to get him a turboman doll , which his wife ( rita wilson , who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this ) told him to get weeks ago . \nso arnold sets out to find a turboman , which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out . \nlet me back up for a minute here -- arnold\'s kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character , which is unhealthy beyond belief . \nwatches the show , eats the cereal , sleeps on the freakin\' turboman sheets . \ni\'d try to discourage any further obsession myself , lest any kid seeing this movie think it\'s a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want . \nbut nooooo , the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade , exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son , who don\'t recognize him until the last minute . \nthis is a sad movie all the way through , but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store , racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa ( jim belushi ) who runs a bootleg toy factory . \nmost painful to watch is a scene at a radio station , where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay ( an embarrassed martin mull ) who said he was giving away a turboman doll . \ncapitalism has produced some pretty evil things ( chia pets ) , but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful . \nnever mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping ( "" your cookies are incredible "" ) , it\'s the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it\'s okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want . \nmaybe that\'s what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house , but not at mine . \n'"

1,"b'in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she\'ll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they\'ll most enjoy . \nsome scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before . \nthis can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat\'s true colors begin to shine through . \nmaking a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom\'s chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year . \nwhat gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom\'s 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what\'s on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences . \nthe bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness . \nchocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion . \nthe bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens . \nmany are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne\'s opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business . \non the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne\'s shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does . \nalso a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends . \njuliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character\'s determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat\'s success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses . \nlena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs . \njudi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin . \ncarrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously . \nvictoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down . \na trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : "" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . "" \nthat\'s not to say the men don\'t do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o\'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne . \nthe technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film . \ncinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman\'s masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules . \nchocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter . \nwhile not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom\'s chocolat is a film which works on all levels-as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale . \nand it even lives up to its name : it is delicious to savor the taste of , easy to digest , and , like all excellent chocolate , it is memorable for days afterward . \nthe bottom line : chocolat is pure pleasure . \n'"

1,"b'slavery is bad . \nafter hundreds of years , we\'ve finally figured that one out . \nthis almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg\'s latest "" serious "" film . \nduring the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa\'s west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery . \nfifty-three of them are stuffed into the "" la amistad "" ( from a spanish word for "" friendship "" ) by their new spanish owners . \nfreeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt . \nafter killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think . \ninstead the ship heads up the coast to the united states . \nthe amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy . \nthe legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property . \nif they are property , who do they belong to ? \ntheir masters ? \nthe spanish government ? \nsalvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? \nthe us government ? \nthe defendants are pawns in several games . \nabolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause . \ntheir lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees . \nsouth carolina senator john c . calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states . \npresident martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends . \nwhen the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes . \neven that doesn\'t work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims . \nat the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners . \nthis little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america\'s past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court . \nthe slavery issue is easy pickin\'s for spielberg . \nmuch like his "" shindler\'s list "" ( which followed "" jurassic park "" as this follows "" lost world "" ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose . \nnazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human . \nit\'s not hard to see who the bad guys are . \nwithout that question to ponder , the director\'s job is more difficult . \nhe has to make the story interesting . \nspielberg succeeds for the most part . \nthe visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach . \nwhere the movie falls down is a bit more subtle . \nthere are very few _people_ in the tale . \nin fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out . \ntappan and joadson are "" abolitionists "" : symbols but not humans . \nvan buren is a weak politician but nothing else . \nthe rest of the "" slaves "" barely exist other than dressing for the set . \nlike many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white . \nthe film\'s salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou . \nthe former model\'s first major role is a winner . \nwithout speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog . \nthe other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in "" nixon "" ) . \nthe impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court-room drama ever on the screen . \nthere are some other great moments . \nespecially impressive are the african\'s struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land . \ntheir interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant . \nas grand as the epic is , it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans . \nmore humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four-star film . \n ( michael redman has written this column for a real long time and is just now getting around to seeing some 1998 films . ) \n'"

1,"b""notice : this is a review and analysis of exotica . \nthe first part of this piece is the review , the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers . \nif you have not seen the movie and after reading the first part you intend to do so , then save the second part for the discussion afterwards . \nstarring : bruce greenwood , mia kirshner , elias kosteas , don mckellar , arsinee khanijian , sarah polley director : atom egoyan screenplay : atom egoyan \nexotica is a film that grows on retrospection . \nexotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film . \nall of the people know each other , but apart from that , there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account . \nthe director hints for possible solutions , using a multi-line plot , so popular with critics in mystery train , and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction . \nexotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique . \nat the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together , in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features . \nthe out-of-chronological-order technique has become ever so popular , perhaps even de rigueur , for biographical films . \nsimilarly , we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use , to varying extent , converging multiplots . \non a first glance , once the multi-plot puzzle in exotica is solved , there seems to be little left to look at . \nbut perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather , commentaries on views of life . \nexotica is very much worth seeing . \nit opened to critic's praise worldwide ( i first saw it in mexico city , last december ) . \nin canada , it broke records for a movie of its kind , which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release . \napart from a strong plot , acting is very convincing , and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie . \nthe spoon-fed-entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie , and thus it might last little on screen . \nbut if you want to try a movie a cut above the crowd , with an originality that is ever so rare , by all means see exotica . \nanalysis ( * * spoilers * * ahead ) \nwhat is behind the complex plot in exotica ? \nfirst , a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means . \nthe lone tax-auditor , the repressed homosexual pet shop owner , the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub , the rich man which has the club remodeled , the audience at the movie theatre , all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul . . . . \nthen we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people , including those who sit watching exotica . . . . \nin that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub , for the rich man looking through silver mirrors , and poor-rich people looking at other's people lives through a silver screen . \nexotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people , such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner . \nexotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner , which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person ( no attraction to the strip dancer ) , and only interested on avoiding jail ( no personal relationship with the tax auditor ) . \nin exotica everybody is watching , and what is worse , everybody knows . \nsecond , exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings ; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters . \nthe strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter , the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter . \nthe niece becomes the baby sitter , the baby sitter becomes the dancer , and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter . \nthe pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj , by finding the proverbial daughter . \na chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle , just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at the end of the movie . \n"""
0,"b""movies based on video games , such as street fighter or mario bros . , have never generated much interest at the box office . \nbut when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 , it did surprisingly well . \nwith a simple story , a pulsating soundtrack , and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes , the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy . \nit got my vote for 'the movie where i expected the least and got the most' . \nand , if you haven't had the opportunity , i would definitely recommend that you see it on video . \nin the world of mortal kombat , based on the popular arcade game , dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth's realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity . \nthe mortal kombat refers to a competition , fought by human mortals against outworld's minions , which if won , will guarantee earth's safety for another generation . \nmk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition . \ndespite their victory , however , a gateway has somehow opened , and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth . \noutworld's warriors include an impressive collection of fighters , including shao kahn , mintoro ( a centaur ) , sheeva ( a four-armed ogre ) , and sindel . \nearth's mortal warriors , under the leadership of the benevolent god , lord rayden , includes liu kang , princess kitana , sonya blade and jax , who must fight against outworld's forces . \nit's an easy enough premise , but unfortunately ( very unfortunately ) , the writers try to do too much with the movie . \nit is only a video game , after all , but the on-screen version tries to go beyond it's comic book boundaries by adding depth , a conceptualization of self-worth , and worst of all , a love story . \nthis becomes very awkward , because all of the players are fighters and nothing more . \nthey are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills , but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act . \nthis becomes embarrassingly apparent , for example , as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana . \nthe original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best . \nthey spoke little , but fought a lot . \nthus , the movie was easy to digest . \nhowever , mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth , an element that was lacking in the first movie , but the attempt here fails miserably . \nthis uneasy feeling is readily apparent , for example , whenever you hear lord rayden speak . \nnot only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic ( e . g . \nuseless ) advice , but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom . \ntry reading this half as fast , and you'll hear what i mean . \nbut the movie is not a complete fatality . \nfight scenes are well-choreographed , highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility . \nand players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game , although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo . \neven if you're not familiar with the video game , each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves . \nbut it's just too little of what movie-goers and especially fans of the game will expect . \noddly , the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence . \nand the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival . \n ( i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom ) . \nrent the first one , but the sequel is for kombat fans only . \n"""

\nwell , yes it does . \nand it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office . \nfor the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment . \nchad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business . \nchad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder . \nhoward is chad\'s boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent . \nwe first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge . \nthere chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her . \nthe reason ? \nboth men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex . \n "" it\'ll restore a little dignity to our lives , "" he says . \nhoward , helpless against the force of chad\'s will , agrees to the plan . \nthey quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp . \nchad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner . \nhoward follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate . \nflattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both . \nyou can guess which one she falls for . \nsoon a tragic lovers\' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she\'s handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him . \nadult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ? \nin chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls . \nhis evil is as subtle as a viper\'s , and as easy as his smile . \nwe watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine\'s heart . \nhis character would be a joke if he wasn\'t so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him . \nhe\'s the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness . \nif one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind . \npolitics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground . \nmen wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory . \nthe most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won\'t describe . \nthe scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril . \ncould it happen in the real world ? \nprobably not . \ntaken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society . \nmaybe it\'s just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience . \nthe entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive . \nthe marvel of labute\'s multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way . \nbut does the film work as entertainment ? \nits darned funny in spots , particularly in the men\'s room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions . \nit works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers . \nstacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her . \nlikewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions . \nby the end of the film you\'ll feel as if you\'ve met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film . \ncertainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed . \nbut the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time . \nlike all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world . \nwhile watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn\'t help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs . \nthere may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad-ness to the level of art . \n'"
0,"b'if you\'re into watching near on two hours of bored , foul-mouthed florida teens having sex , doing drugs , having sex , listening to eminem , having sex , playing video games , having sex , and killing one of their peers , then "" bully "" \'s for you . \nbased on jim schutze\'s novelization of a true-life event , "" bully "" charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who , in 1993 , murdered their high school bully in cold , calculated blood . \nthe film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers . \nin the hands of controversial director larry clark ( "" kids "" ) , however , it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker\'s pornographic proclivities . \nin terms of the incident and what provoked it , "" bully "" stirs up nothing new . \nthe high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot--bored with life , not much ambition , promiscuous , profane . \nthe bully in question , bobby kent ( nick stahl ) , is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesn\'t exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department . \nhe hounds and harries and humiliates his "" best friend "" marty ( played by brad renfro ) and marty\'s girlfriend lisa ( rachel miner ) doesn\'t care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby . \nsimply remove him from the equation . \nmarty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous , profane , and stoner friends , plus a recruited hit man ( ? ) , lure bobby to a swamp one night , stab him , beat him over the head with a baseball bat , and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators , presumably , finish him off . \nthere\'s no remorse--the next day they\'re talking about it as openly as a homework assignment . \nthey did it because they wanted to , and because they could . \nwhat\'s most troubling about the film , however , isn\'t the unsettling subject matter and the matter-of-fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material . \nnot only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in "" bully "" but there\'s also an uneasy , exploitative feel to it . \ngratuitous crotch shots abound ( one of which makes the zipper cut-away in "" there\'s something about mary "" look like the height of subtlety ! ) . \nclark is so pre-occupied with his female ( predominantly ) leads that you forget , at times , what this movie is supposed to be about . \nthe stripping bare , literally and figuratively , of these actors ( who are , after all , playing underage teenagers ) becomes harder to watch over time , as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera . \nthe conclusion of "" bully "" offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime . \nit\'s a short sequence of stills--heather : 7 years ; ali : 40 years ; lisa : life imprisonment , for example--but it\'s infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it . \n "" bully "" aims for truth , exploits it shamelessly , then bludgeons it to death . \n'"

1,"b'after hearing reviews for woody allen\'s upteenth movie in history , "" celebrity , "" range from terribly boring to just so-so , my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of "" manhattan , "" my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time . \nwoody allen\'s films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair , so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand-in-hand ( "" manhattan "" really is one of the best-looking films i\'ve ever seen , beautiful black and white photography of the city\'s best areas , etc . ) , a fan can\'t help but feel visibly moved . \nthe film opens up , with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds , and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack , but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky , with the word "" help "" being spelled with an airplane . \nbeethoven\'s 5th blasts on the soundtrack . \nthe city seems to stop to take notice of this moment , and it\'s all rather lovely to look at . \nand then we cut to a film crew , shooting this as the film\'s hilariously banal key moment in the film , where the lead actress in the film ( melanie griffith , looking as buxom and beautiful as ever ) has to realize something\'s wrong with her life or whatever . \nit\'s a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film , with the great opening shots or without , and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again , a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works ( though , for the record , last year\'s "" deconstructing harry "" came awfully close ) . \nwhat the hell has happened to him ? \nthe man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny , but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas . \n "" bullets over broadway , "" though wonderful , relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off . \n "" mighty aphrodite "" is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story . \n "" everyone says i love you "" was more of a great idea than a great film . \neven "" deconstructing harry "" is admittingly cheap in a way , even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films . \nif anything , the reception of "" celebrity "" by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time , it\'s not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is : it\'s him . \n "" celebrity "" is , yes , a good film , but it\'s only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film . \ninstead of creating the great woody allen world , he\'s created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about . \nand he\'s fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities , so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections . \nit\'s like "" la dolce vita "" without the accuracy , the right amount of wit , and the correct personal crisis . \nwoody , becoming more insecure in his old age , choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities , and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny , and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead . \nmuch has been said about his performance - dead on but irritating , makes one yearn for the real thing , blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh\'s performance , though featuring some of the same mannerisms ( stuttering , whining , lots o\' hand gestures ) , is hardly a warts-and-all impersonation . \nbranagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm , which actually allows for his character\'s flaws to be more apparent . \nwoody\'s a flawed guy , and we know it , but we love him anyway , because he\'s really funny and really witty and really intelligent . \nbranagh\'s allen is a bit more flat-out bad , but with the same charm so that , yes , we like him , but we\'re still not sure if he\'s really a good person or not . \nhis character , lee simon , is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie , hits on extra actress winona ryder , then goes off to interview griffith , who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her , and she denies him . . . sorta . \nwe then learn , through flashbacks , that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid-life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion . \nhe has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts , covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate , so that he can meet them , and maybe sell his script ( a bank robbery movie "" but with a deep personal crisis "" ) . \nas such , he has divorced his wife of several years ( allen regular judy davis ) , and continues on a quest for sexual happiness , boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film . \nafter griffith comes his escapades with a model ( charlize theron ) who is "" polymorphously perverse "" ( glad to see allen is using new jokes , ha ha ) , who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of "" la dolce vita . "" \nfollowing are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen , a relationship that almost assures him success , and his continued escapades with ryder , whom he fancies most of all . \nhis story is juxtaposed with that of davis , who flips out , but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome , friendly tv exec ( joe mantegna ) who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status . \nwhile lee is fumbling about , selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness , davis becomes happy ( "" i\'ve become the kind of woman i\'ve always hated . . . and \ni\'m loving it .

0,"b'54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \na greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors . \ni , however , would rather cut to the chase . \n54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \nthere is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight . \nthere is no electricity in any of the scenes , or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots . \nand it\'s underdeveloped , and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they\'re in this year\'s boogie nights . \nthey are so wrong . \nthe picture has been assembled by mark christopher . \nbased on this film , i don\'t know how he got a job in the business . \n54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s . \ni don\'t know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released , but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson\'s brilliant work in every possible way , from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography . \nwhat it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great : depth , intelligence , energy , fascinating characters , and challenging themes . \n54 can\'t even measure up to the last days of disco , which is flawed , but still smart and entertaining . \nit\'s remarkably bad timing , i\'d say , to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind . \ni have exaggerated , though : there is one interesting character , and one terrific performance . \nthat character is steve rubell , played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves . \nsteve rubell is the owner of studio 54 , and if christopher had focused on him , then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself . \nalas , we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a going-nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club , thanks to rubell\'s homosexual impulses . \nit\'s here that he meets his friends , the array of uninteresting characters : his co-worker , greg ( brecklin meyer ) , his wife , anita ( salma hayek ) , and , of course , the love interest , julie black ( neve campbell ) . \nshane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning , and he has a reasonably sturdy home life . \n ( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting , while heather matarazzo , who plays his sister , pushes phillippe off the screen . ) \nbut he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene , and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs . \nwhy his "" friends "" push him into drugs is never really explained , but the fact that they are "" friends "" is questioned only is superficial ways ( greg gets really mad at shane because he\'s been elevated to bartender status ) . \nthere isn\'t a single conflict that takes center stage , except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works . \nmost of the film is dumb , and most of the dialogue is inane . \nthere\'s a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black , and , in the next scene , they\'re arm-in-arm without a bit of development . \nthen , they\'re kissing in a bowling alley ! \nthis is five minutes of material , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one-hour mark , and this isn\'t a long film to begin with ) . \ncampbell is a talented actress , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth . \nthis one doesn\'t . \nand phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever ; this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg\'s star-making role in boogie nights . \nhe seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone . \ni guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but he seems pretty lanky to me . \nhe\'s all wrong for a lead role , but it doesn\'t help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters . \nby the end of 54 , shane\'s most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent . \nthe rest of the performances are wasted . \nhayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and does almost nothing here . \nmeyer is endearing , but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard . \nonly myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher\'s wading-pool of a script . \nrubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters , but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance . \nin fact , myers is the sole reason to see 54 , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him . \ni\'ve read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail . \nfrankly , i don\'t care . \nit\'s easy to recreate something technical like this . \na fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task . \nbesides , christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible , anyway . \naside from myers\' performance , 54 is a complete failure . \nit\'s dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \nsome may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair , but they\'re so obvious to me . \nin any event , 54 is pallid without the contrast . \nit doesn\'t even work as mindless entertainment : it\'s so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it . \nso , don\'t forget those key words : dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \neverything else i said was just padding . \n'"
1,"b'john von neumann , progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project , pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos , even without recourse to faster-than light travel . \nyou send out self-replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information . \nit may take decades , centuries , or millennia , but it can be done with achievable technology , and doesn\'t require a magical faster-than-light drive . \nin the fifties , british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it ; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real-time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned . \nabout thirty-five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer/writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini-series called a for andromeda . \nafa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer\'s analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication . \nshe was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then-unknown julie christie . \naudience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings . \ndennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well-structured movie scripts ; they start out great , and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action , mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl . \nfeldman writes good scenes , but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie , even with a previous version to use as a model . \nnow , in species , we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline , derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter , gore , and chases . \nspecies features ben kingsley , who is completely wasted in a badly-written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist . \nforest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script . \nthe species story is relatively simple ; we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971 , and have been receiving answers for two years . \n ( note that , in the 1970\'s , we really didn\'t know diddly about the human genome structure , and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings . \neven today , all we can do is give information about dna and how it works , not a copy of human dna , because we don\'t have it analyzed yet . ) \nthe answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race , and doctor xavier finch , played by ben kingsley , is placed in charge of the attempt . \nthe script begins to go off the deep end at this point , when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape-shift into any of several ugly alien life forms . \nthe first half of the film has something to offer , as "" sil , "" the alien girl , struggles with her multi-form existence , changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again , all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos . \nshe seems oddly knowledgeable about human society , with glaring gaps where her social skills should be . \nher instincts are to mate and procreate , and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area . \nescaping from her birth laboratory in utah , sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her . \nshe goes on an eating binge , spins herself a cocoon , and emerges as an adult , played by natasha henstridge , who goes a long way toward re-creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960 . \nthe pursuers : michael madsen is an assassin/exterminator ; forrest whitaker is a convenient empath/psychic , just as though the u . s . government actually had such people on call . \nneither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided . \nwhitaker\'s role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek : the next generation\'s "" counselor cleavage . "" \nthe other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina . \nkingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals , too good to not work to the best of their abilities ; but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland , and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak . \nh . r . giger\'s design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it , although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly . \nthe main fault of species is lack of originality ; it starts out with a wonderful , albeit borrowed , premise , and then doesn\'t live up to it . \nall we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes , with a few monsters tossed in . \nthere is no buildup of tension and suspense , no climax worthy of the name ; species is just a sequence of "" scare "" scenes stuck together . \nthe movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes , but not rescued by them . \non the other hand , as an exercise in sci-fi action/ adventure , it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd . \nspecies earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board , but by and large , it\'s fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing . \nmy personal rating is three stars , but knock one or two of those off if you don\'t enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters . \nmpaa classification : r ( violence , gore , nudity , sex , language ) \nstars : ben kingsley , michael madsen , forest whitaker , alfred molina , marg helgenberger , natasha henstridge directed by : roger donaldson produced by : frank mancuso jr . and dennis feldman typed by : dennis feldman cinematography : andrzej bartkowiak music : christopher young run time : 108 minutes aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 from mgm , opens 7 july 1995 \n'"

1,"b'with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the "" film noir "" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller\'s crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) . \ntheir latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film . \nthe main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn\'t quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who\'s wise to the world , but he doesn\'t really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax . \nthat main character is jeffrey "" the dude "" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film\'s rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as "" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . "" \nthe dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who\'s in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody\'s cheating in a bowling match ( "" has the whole world gone crazy ? ! "" he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who\'s always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( "" donny , you have no frame of reference here ! "" ) . \nthese three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of "" hotel california "" and , if it\'s possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter . \nif that doesn\'t give you a good idea of this film\'s absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude\'s rug . \nthey\'ve mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the "" big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) . \nthe dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn\'t have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom . \nunfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude\'s car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money . \nsoon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german "" nihilists "" who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn . \nmeanwhile , the big lebowski\'s daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family . \nthe plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc . \nthe previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival\'s "" run through the jungle , "" and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) . \nthe film doesn\'t feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens\' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude\'s dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact . \nthe film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this "" jungle "" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution . \nthere\'s also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his "" this aggression will not stand "" speech . \nthe coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( "" the bums will always lose ! "" \nshouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their "" peaceful beach community , "" and so on . \nby the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least "" aggression "" of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on "" passive , "" albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters . \nhe also turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head , even if he doesn\'t like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he\'s getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end . \nthe coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they don\'t just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either . \ni think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter-brained . \naudience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un-dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first . \n "" it\'s good knowin\' he\'s out there , the dude , takin\' it easy , "" posits the narrator towards the end . \ni dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken . \n'"

1,"b'the computer-animated comedy "" shrek "" is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups . \nfor children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) . \nfor adults , it\'s a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids . \nall in all , "" shrek "" is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing . \nbut first the basics . \nbased very loosely on a 1990 children\'s story , "" shrek "" follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using . \nshrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace . \npetty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the "" awk "" in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides . \nhe proceeds to turn the ogre\'s yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle . \nas a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few . \nan enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain . \nlord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from "" snow white "" has shown him the way . \nall he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife . \nthe mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of "" the dating game "" ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , "" even though she lives with seven men , she\'s not easy !

"" \nbut the lion\'s share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney . \nthe public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a "" possessed toy "" and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , "" get that dead broad off the table ! "" \n ? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad\'s royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like "" it\'s a small world . "" \nwhich brings me to disturbing point number one . \ni laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad . \nthe acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known . \nfor years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other\'s film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day . \nand now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer . \nhere\'s a suggestion for the two boys : grow up ! \nput the past behind you ! \nthere\'s room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can\'t play nice , then go to your rooms ! \nthe other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad . \nbeyond all the irreverence , "" shrek "" actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within . \nit\'s a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad\'s diminutive stature . \ndo we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ? \nthe pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers . \nadding short jokes is simply mean . \nstill , "" shrek "" is a rollicking good time . \nthe computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one . \nto trot out a clich ? , "" shrek "" is fun for all ages . \nparents , though , should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short , tall , skinny , fat , etc . is a bad thing . \n'"

1,"b'i can already feel the hate letters pouring in on this one , folks . \ni loved the wedding singer . \nbut it gets worse . \nif i so much as mention titanic in the same sentence . \n . \n . \nhell , same paragraph as the wedding singer , i\'m bound to be lynched . \nwell lynch me then , because i thought adam sandler and drew barrymore had the most convincing chemistry in recent memory , with titanic as the only exception . \nright away , you\'re ready to discount my review , aren\'t you ? \nyou\'re thinking that i can\'t possibly know what i\'m talking about . \nafter all , this is adam sandler right ? ? ? \nwell , there\'s more . \n . \n . \ni actually got choked up , and more than once . \nyes , the man who brought us billy madison and happy gilmore was able to bring sincere tears to my eyes . \nbut before you shrug me off as an imbecile , i urge you to see the movie and see for yourself . \nthe wedding singer is the story of robby hart ( sandler ) , a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement in life has been performing cover tunes at wedding receptions for the past five years or so . \nbut when his own wedding results in a no-show for the bride ( angela featherstone as linda ) , robby begins to re-examine his life , and wonder why true love doesn\'t exist for people like him . \nin the process of performing at these receptions , robby meets a waitress named julia , played with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore , whose reputation is anything but this character . \njulia too is engaged , and when robby finds himself without a wife , his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding , seeing as how her fiance , the "" miami vice "" loving glenn ( matthew glave ) , doesn\'t seem all that interested . \nas the time goes by , we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding - he\'s merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup , something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women . \nit\'s obvious that robby is going to fall for julia and feel a strong need to rescue her , but what is a lighthearted romantic comedy for ? \nthis isn\'t sleepless in seattle , but i\'d actually compare it to that before i\'d compare it to happy gilmore . \nwhile the wedding singer maintains some of that post-snl cornball humor , its sincerity and charm carry it a very , very long way . \nsandler is great in his role , and yes , if you allow it , you can take him seriously . \nbarrymore seems perfect along side him , and although the two more likely represent gen-x moronism and party-girl ditzism ( respectively ) , the two go together like bread and butter as a mid-eighties couple . \none scene in particular , where julia ponders the future in a mirror , is so well done , i was on the verge of tears . \nunfortunately , sandler is going to make a lot of people shrug this one off as a no-brainer , but it\'s got so much surprise substance packed inside that i\'m encouraging everyone to go see it . \nin fact , the entire theater applauded when the film ended , and laughs were so consistent , some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar . \nthe 1985 setting was milked for everything it was worth , and for those of us that are old enough to remember it , it was a bodacious trip back ( and done very well ) . \nsandler shows a new side to himself while maintaining all his original charm ( or is it anti-charm ? ) . \nwhile the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit , grading it on pure enjoyability would give this one four stars . \nit\'s hilarious , and it\'s touching . \nit\'s got that great cheezy humor , but it also takes sandler to a higher level than anyone expected . \nthis is one to see again and again . \nis it possible the wedding singer could be one of the sweetest romantic comedies of 1998 ? \nmy "" magic 8-ball "" predicts it is certain . \n'"

1,"b'sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film . \nsometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride . \ni saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers , most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes . \nsurprised , they may have been , when they realized that this picture actually had something to say . \nbut by the attentiveness of the crowd i\'d say they were won over - as was i . i can\'t tell yet if truman really is that good , or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year . \ntime alone will make that call . \nbut by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank\'s side . \nwe were concerned for his well-being , and wanted him to win . \nthat we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey , who has achieved legitimacy at last . \nthe truman show is a film best viewed cold , with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot . \nunless you\'re under a media blackout , however , you probably know the basics . \ncarrey stars as truman burbank , a capra-esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl ( laura linney ) in the south florida island town of seahaven , which looks like michael eisner\'s idea of the perfect american small town . \ntruman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle , complete with a working wife , a best bud , friendly neighbors and interesting co-workers . \nthere is tragedy in his past - his father drowned in a horrible boating accident , leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water , and of travel in general - but overall , life is good . \nbut then one day as truman leaves his house for work , a klieg light falls magically from the sky . \nthis curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows : that he is a prisoner on the world\'s biggest soundstage , that his wife , friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him , and that his life has , for over 10 , 000 days , been broadcast as the world\'s most popular television program . \nwhat makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir . \nthe soundstage , we\'re told , is "" only the second man-made structure visible from space . "" \ntruman\'s movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 , 000 cameras scattered throughout the town : button cams , dashboard cams , mirror cams , wife cams , big cams and small cams . \nweir cuts the film so we\'re never quite sure if we\'re watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show\'s omnipotent creator christof ( ed harris ) who oversees the show from a control room built into the man-made moon in seahaven\'s sky . \nthe second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence . \nhis best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) always has a six pack of beer with him . \nhis wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product . \nhe sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town . \none wonders why he didn\'t pick up on any of this earlier , but christof has an answer for this : "" people tend to accept the reality with which they\'re presented . "" \nnevertheless , truman begins to grow restless , and dreams of escape to fiji , where an old college sweetheart ( natasha mcelhone ) supposedly lives . \nthis convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept ; the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way . \nby underplaying truman , he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over . \nthere is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon , and marlon answers with best-friend sincerity , "" i\'d gladly step in front of a bus for you . "" \nbut that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof . \nthe abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home - and from that moment , we\'re on his side . \nthe truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies - haven\'t we all , at least once , doubted our place in the world , doubted the sincerity of those closest to us ? \nultimately , however , the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator . \nwhat does god really think of us ? \ndoes he resent our abandonment of paradise ? \nwho exactly is watching us , up there in the sky ? \nif you enjoy the picture as much as i did , credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work . \nas for carrey - well , truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play . \ncarrey is no jimmy stewart ; to his credit , he doesn\'t try to be . \nhe just tries to feel the way you or i would , if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us . \n'"

"" \nwas one line , if i remember correctly . \nat the end of the 19th century , col . patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda . \nhe is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off . \npatterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) . \nthe movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy . \nthey are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature . \ngive me a break . \nthe movie hasn\'t got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it\'s just trying to find convenient ways to stall us . \neven the lion hunts themselves are idiotic . \nget this : remington\'s big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up . \nhe does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird . \nby the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand . \nthe acting is forgettable . \ndouglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow , but it\'s nothing he hasn\'t done before . \nkilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else , somewhere else , and the rest vanish into the cinematography . \nthe camera , by the way , sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent . \nwhat did i expect from this movie ? \ni dunno . \nsome real excitement , i suppose . \na sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation . \nno such luck . \ni dug out my tattered copy of hemingway\'s "" the short happy life of francis macomber "" and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind . \n'"

1,"b' "" no man is an island , "" one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie\'s themes . \nwhile hardly a great film , singer\'s ambitious adaptation of king\'s short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . \napt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . \n1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . \nbowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd\'s theory . \nbowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden\'s intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . \nthe stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd\'s desire for gory details overrides his repulsion . \nbowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii . \nmarching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his "" student "" , among other things . \nbowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship . \ndussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future . \nall of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material\'s excessive climax . \nsinger has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system . \nhis the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal\'s tics and todd\'s golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals . \napt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . \nthankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects\' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system . \nsome scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer\'s handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training . \nmckellan\'s and renfro\'s performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan\'s finely-tuned realization , i\'d like to single out renfro\'s daring work . \nhe isn\'t afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn\'t do . \n ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? ) \nrenfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesn\'t continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . \nas guidance counsellor edward french , "" friend "" schwimmer also deserves mention . \nhe wants to be the parent to todd that todd\'s own well-to-do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil\'s blackening-heart even more apparent . \nbut one of the film\'s ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . \nno man is an island , indeed-we all have the capacity to make the "" right "" or the "" wrong "" choices . \nschwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible . \n-october , 1998 \n * the excellent collection king\'s stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil , but the shawshank redemption ( originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption ) and stand by me ( originally titled the body ) . \n'"
1,"b""not since 1996's shine , which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott , has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world-class musicians . \nin fact , if one were to watch these films together , it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills . \nyet hilary and jackie , the sophomore effort from director anand tucker , has something more to say -- it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale . \nemily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale , playing the sisters du pr ? . \nboth musicians from childhood , hilary ( griffiths ) is renowned flutist while jacqueline ( watson ) is easily as skilled on the cello . \nthe two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women , both together and seperate . \ntheir careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another's , and although their lives take very different paths -- hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour -- they are bound together by their deep family love . \nthe performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance . \nthey contrast each other wonderfully , and while watson's portrayal of jackie du pr ? is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic , both characters are charged with emotion . \nthe frank cottrell boyce script , which is based on the book by hilary and piers du pr ? , brings a great deal of depth to these characters as well . \nthe script is also to be commended for its well-polished dual nature . \ncottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller ( which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert towne's script for mission : impossible ) and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame . \nthe latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least , and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story . \nsome will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised . \nnevertheless , hilary and jackie is a movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals and is a decent watch all around . \n"""

1,"b'when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be "" you too can believe whales can fly "" . \nthen it was going to be "" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly "" . \nthen , it was going to be "" you too can believe wood sprites can fly "" . \nfinally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . . \nthere\'s a lot of flying going on in this film ! \nas our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in . \nwell apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released . \npart of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release ) . \nsubsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) . \nto celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high . \nin an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us . \nafter the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters . \nis the format effective for the film ? \nwith a few exceptions , yes . \nthe first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven\'s fifth symphony . \nit\'s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily . \neverything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts . \neventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things . \nthough this segment isn\'t very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies . \nthe next segment is set to ottorino respighi\'s "" the pines of rome "" . \nin this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape . \na whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack . \nhe is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the "" oceans "" of clouds . \nagain , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved . \nreportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size . \nthe cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images . \none especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent . \nabsolutely beautiful stuff . \nthe third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin\'s "" rhapsody in blue "" . \nthis segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york . \nthere\'s a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife . \ni won\'t go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending . \nunfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments . \nsegment four is set to dmitri shostakovich\'s "" piano concerto no . 2 "" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen\'s "" the steadfast tin soldier "" . \na one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can\'t see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester . \nthe jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina . \nlittle does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from . \nthe soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl . \nalthough the ending has been altered from the andersen story , "" the steadfast tin soldier "" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short . \nsome children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made . \nsegment five is the funniest of the bunch . \nset to camille saint-saens "" the carnival of the animals "" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number . \nwhile it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy . \nsegment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it\'s the one that people remember most , "" the sorcerer\'s apprentice "" . \nthe story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo . \nunfortunately , the segment wasn\'t made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain . \nthere were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain . \nsimilar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters . \nsegment seven is set to sir edward elgar\'s "" pomp and circumstance march no . 1 "" and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character . \ndonald duck "" stars "" as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark . \nduring the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn\'t make it on the boat . \nthey are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners . \ndespite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear-jerkers foisted on audiences these days . \npowerful stuff . \nsegment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? "" saving the best for last "" . \nset to igor stravinsky\'s "" the firebird "" , an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape . \ntrees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation . \nwhen the sprite examines the formation , it awakens and becomes the titular firebird . \nin a stunning spectacle , the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path , including everything that the sprite has worked to create . \nsome amazing animation is present here , and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone ( although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film ) . \nthe host segments are largely ( no pun intended ) throwaways , although steve martin\'s clip is pretty funny . \nbe sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin . \npenn and teller are usually funny , but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting . \nthe best segment comes from , of all people , bette midler , who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board . \npieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner\'s "" ride of the valkyries "" , and a strange segment prepared in the \'40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments . \nfor fans of visual stimulation or classical music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon . \nthe film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material . \nas i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters . \ni must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though . \nthen you too can believe that whales/triangle things/sprites can fly . \n[g] \n'"
1,"b' "" rebel without a cause "" is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to . \neveryone feels that they are different in some way , that they don\'t belong in some places and "" rebel without a cause "" successfully shows on screen these universal emotions . \nno matter what generation you belong to , these feelings are present . \nthis is why james dean is admired by america , because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute . \nin our minds , we just try to do the right thing just like dean\'s jim stark does . \nnot only does "" rebel without a cause "" display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure . \neach generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection . \nthis is because times change and in response people change . \nno matter how popular you were once , as your generation grows older , newer breeds look at you in a different light . \nthis is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents . \neven if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past , the teens could not believe this . \nin one humorous scene , stark , his girlfriend judy ( natalie wood ) , and his pal plato ( sal mineo ) pretend they are adults . \nthey use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored . \nthis scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another . \nspeaking on behalf of my generation , i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by . \nthe only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation . same \ngoes for brando , redford , even deniro . \ni can only imagine how vaguely matt damon , ben affleck , and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century . \nwill dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten ? \nany film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film . \neven if "" rebel without a cause "" has some ridiculous scenes ( the game of chicken - did people really act this way ? ) , an unbelievable conclusion ( how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end ? ) , and a silly romance ( wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours ) it still is a fabulous film . \nthe acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool . \nnow , however , the coolness is fading . . . \n'"
1,"b'let\'s say you live at the end of an airport runway . \nlarge jetliners continuously pass over your house , rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace . \nlet\'s say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances , and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home . \nnow let\'s say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it\'s worth . \nwouldn\'t you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ? \nof course you would . \nbut what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ? \nthat\'s what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he\'s happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it\'s not for sale . \nunfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice . \nnot about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back . \nthe castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i\'ve seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest . \nin fact , it is this film\'s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful . \nthe good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets . \nit\'s the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn\'t have to think all that much while watching this film . \ni just sat back and enjoyed myself . \nthe situation is one we\'ve seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever . \nwhat makes this film different is its characters . \ndarryl thinks he\'s got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he\'s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) , and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard . \nsteve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for "" investments "" like jousting sticks and overhead projectors , while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto\'s incompetent courtroom maneuvers . \nthe great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren\'t so stupid that they get annoying . \nthey\'re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing . \nwe look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection . \nscreenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans . \nsympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family\'s wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them . \ni suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works . \ni particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs . \ndon\'t get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius . \nit\'s just that too often , a film will resort to it\'s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully . \ninstead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world . \nwhen they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious . \none of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . \nthe kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film\'s running time . \nluckily , it\'s a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film\'s main drive , is still quite enjoyable . \nwith all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes . \ni\'m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate . \nand , for that matter , it\'s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this . \n'"
1,"b'if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue , we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia . \nalthough some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle\'s high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones . \nuntil that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters . \ncontemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times . \none of such movies , one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen , is william friedkin\'s to live and die in l . a . \nthe money isn\'t just the symbolic motive in the film , it is the major elements of the plot . \nrick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps , and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career , masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected . \nrichard chance ( william l . petersen ) is a secret service agent , adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters . \nhowever , his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another . \nfinally he sets up a final sting , but his superiors deny him the necessary money . \nbeing frustrated , and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich ( bill pankow ) , he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier . \ntheir plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent , but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway . \nlike french connection , one of his previous masterpieces , this friedkin\'s movie was inspired by real life . \ngerrald petievich , author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay , spent many years working as a secret service agent . \nthat turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency , not much utilised by hollywood . \nsecret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie\'s hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan\'s speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times . \nultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie . \nwillem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath , whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn\'t seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary , those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable . \ncompared with him , and all the other side characters that want their "" piece of the action "" , two heroes on the side of law seem like losers . \ninstead of being a classical good guy , secret service agent richard chance ( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far ) is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement ; his sidekick , who should serve as those "" better judgement "" is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end . \nin such surroundings of moral decay , the not so happy , yet surprising ending doesn\'t seem out of line ( although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered ) . \nthe dark atmosphere of l . a . - city of glamour and moral decay - is nicely captured by william friedkin\'s directing skills . \nthe tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro , dean stockwell , debra feuer , darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase . \nthat scene alone , with lot of realism , thrills and surprise twists , is worth seeing the rest of the film . \nthe soundtrack , provided by now almost forgotten band "" wang chung "" , is also one of the more memorable of that decade . \nin every case , to live and die in l . a . is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it . \n'"
1,"b'scream 2 isn\'t quite as clever as its predecessor , but it fills the gap with a cutting wit . \ndeath -- even gruesome , bloody death -- can be funny if handled the right way ( some will be offended by this statement , but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example ) . \nand , while there\'s plenty of horror to go around in scream 2 , the latest \'90s slasher flick incarnation , there are also a few laughs to be had . \nscream 2 is a slice-and-dice movie for those who don\'t take their horror too seriously . \nthe success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise . \nthe unexpected blockbuster , whose gross soared over the $100 million mark during its six month release window , opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time . \na sequel was inevitable ; fortunately , nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2 , including director wes craven , screenwriter kevin williamson , and actors neve campbell , courtney cox , david arquette , jamie kennedy , and liev schreiber . \nas stipulated by one of the "" rules of sequels "" uttered by a movie- obsessed character in the film , the body count in scream 2 is higher than that in the original . \nparadoxically , there\'s a lot less gore . \nthere is blood , of course , but nothing excessive by slasher-movie standards , and there are no depictions of spilled entrails . \ncraven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids . \na second strength of scream 2 is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut-out stereotypes lined up for slaughter . \nafter all , we\'ve known some of these people for two movies -- it\'s almost impossible not to care about them at least a little . \nscream 2 opens approximately two years after the original . \nas in the first picture , there\'s a slick , self-mocking prologue . \nthis time , the victims are jada pinkett and omar epps , whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of the movie stab ( which is based on the "" true life "" events of scream ) . \nsome of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films ( it\'s surely no coincidence that , in addition to pinkett and epps , scream 2 features two black characters ) . \nshortly thereafter , she and her boyfriend have been gutted , signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders . \ncraven lets loose a burst of tongue-in-cheek creativity for the "" movie within a movie "" sequences . \nthey give him an opportunity to openly parody scream -- an act that he accomplishes with great panache . \nstab features heather graham in the "" casey becker "" role ( played in the original by drew barrymore ) and tori spelling as "" sidney prescott "" ( neve campbell ) . \nsadly , we only see a couple of scenes from stab . \nit would have been a little more fun , i think , had craven used joe dante\'s approach from matinee and shown lengthy excerpts from his satirical production . \nfollowing the prologue , we are re-introduced to sidney prescott , who has left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college . \nher friend randy ( jamie kennedy ) is a student there as well , and he\'s just as knowledgeable about horror films as ever . \nonce the double murder at stab becomes big news , the media converges on windsor , looking to interview the original victim . \nat the head of the flock of vultures is gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who has a little surprise for sidney . \nshe has brought cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney falsely accused of murder , with her . \nalso arriving at the college is deputy dewey ( david arquette ) , who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round of tribulations . \nin addition to the survivors from the original scream , the field of potential victims is well-populated . \nthere\'s a blond co-ed named cece ( sarah michelle gellar , who has now appeared in two of williamson\'s movies -- this one and i know what you did last summer ) ; sidney\'s requisite boyfriend , derek ( jerry o\'connell ) ; a local newswoman ( laurie metcalf ) ; gale\'s new cameraman ( duane martin ) ; a british drama teacher ( david warner ) ; and several sorority sisters and would-be sorority sisters ( portia de rossi , rebecca gayheart , elise neal , marisol nichols ) . \nultimately , there are lots of attractive corpses . \nfrom the stab scenes to lines like "" brothers don\'t last long in situations like this , "" craven and williamson are clearly having a lot of fun with scream 2 , and the movie is enjoyable , if a little overlong ( the livelier first hour is better than the second ) . \ntheir resolution to the obligatory "" whodunit ? "" \nis less of a letdown than it could be , and knowingly offers a wink and nod at past unmasking scenes . \n ( "" nice twist , "" quips the killer . \n "" didn\'t see it coming , didya ? "" ) \none senses , however , that , by the end of this picture , the overall concept of a hip , self-referential slasher film has been played out . \nsupposedly , there\'s going to be a scream 3 , but , if the film makers don\'t come up with something radical , we could end up with a classic case of sequel overkill . \n'"
1,"b'with three pre- to mid-teen children and an aging father-in-law to care for--cooking and cleaning and laundry , drop-offs at little league practice and pick-ups from ballet practice--margaret hall\'s life is rife with complications . \nand with her naval officer husband stationed somewhere in the north atlantic , virtually impossible to reach by telephone , margaret leads the crazed life of a single parent . \nbut margaret\'s hectic world is about to get a lot more complicated . \nher teenage son beau , a talented trumpet player with strong prospects of being accepted into wesleyan university\'s music program , has fallen in with the wrong crowd . \nhis mother drives from their idyllic , lakeside community of tahoe city , california to the sprawling urban metropolis of reno , nevada , with its imposing concrete superstructures and seedy neon-lit nightclubs , to confront the 30-something man who has befriended beau . \n "" stay away from my son "" margaret warns darby reese . \nher words , however , appear to fall on deaf ears as reese turns up drunk at the family homestead later that evening , urging beau to join him in the boathouse . \nthere are words and advances and some pushing and shoving and beau runs back into the house , passed his startled mother , as the crack of a wooden railing giving way breaks the cold blue silence and an intoxicated reese tumbles out of sight . \nthe next day , on her morning walk , margaret discovers reese\'s lifeless body lying crumpled on the shoreline , a boat anchor impaled in his chest . \nwith her maternal instincts working overtime , margaret quickly ferries the body out into the lake , weighs it down , and dumps it overboard . \nbut margaret\'s life is about to get a lot more complicated . \nsoon after the body is discovered , snagged on a local fisherman\'s line , margaret is paid a visit by an attractive-seeming blackmailer in a red nova . \nalek spera threatens to hand over compromising videotape of beau to the police unless margaret comes up with $50 , 000 by 4 o\'clock the next day . \nbut margaret\'s life is about to get a lot more complicated , for alek turns out to be something she never expected . \nbased on elisabeth sanxay holding\'s novel "" the blank wall , "" "" the deep end "" is a well-crafted thriller written and directed by scott mcgehee and david siegel ( "" suture "" ) . \nit makes the most of a talented but not particularly well-known cast--goran visnjic plays alek with a suave likeability , jonathan tucker shines as the conflicted beau , peter donat is amusing as grandfather hall , and josh lucas has an equally small but effective role as the hapless darby reese . \nthe film is also lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens and features an evocative score , courtesy peter nashel . \nbut it owes everything to british actress tilda swinton . \nswinton , whose pale-faced ethereal beauty has graced many of derek jarman\'s films ( "" caravaggio , "" "" edward ii , "" "" the last of england "" ) , plays margaret hall in "" the deep end "" and , like charlotte rampling in this year\'s "" under the sand , "" turns in a commanding and accomplished performance . \nmargaret is a devoted mother who is willing to risk everything to protect the ones she loves , and swinton captures every frustration , every fear , every subtle examination and every fervent realization and every nervous oscillation of her being . \nthe role calls for an extremely wide range of emotions none the least of which is simply playing a mother beset with a multitude of domestic responsibilities . \nmany can relate to that , of course ; it\'s the murder cover-up and the blackmail and the fear of losing one\'s son that swinton so gracefully , so graciously , makes resonate with the truest of colors . \nthe end is deep all right , and there isn\'t a single shallow moment in tilda swinton\'s canon . \n'"
0,"b'in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black . \nsir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner . \nhis oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake . \nthe daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes . \nhopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts . \nwhichever one you like , dear , he says . \nand the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries . \ni liked that scene for two reasons . \nfirst , the cakes looked really cool . \nsecond , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act . \nmeet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot . \nit\'s easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it\'s even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) . \nthe difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess . \ni know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy . \ncase in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie . \nhowever , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani . \n ( it\'s not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . ) \nit shouldn\'t take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt . \nand indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished . \nwell , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous . \nso , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately . \nanyway , the deceased lawyer\'s body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role . \nthe idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world . \nif this weren\'t hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who\'s wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn\'t know how to act in our society . \nit also doesn\'t help that the character of death is written so inconsistently . \nhe claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) . \nhe speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois . \nhe knows everything about some characters , nothing about others . \nand as played by brad pitt , he\'s not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he\'s just there . \nit\'s as if someone told pitt , "" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . "" \nit\'s as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie . \ni\'ve used the phrase "" angel of death "" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt\'s performance with this year\'s best angel performance , nicolas cage\'s in city of angels . \nwhere pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows . \nwhere cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant . \ncage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani\'s character is so shallow that she can\'t see beyond pitt\'s good looks . \nthe movie\'s other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn\'t save meet joe black . \nsir anthony hopkins isn\'t given much better material to work with , unfortunately . \nhe plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood . \n ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins\'s character more realistically evil . ) \nhopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world . \nof course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder . \nbut i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire . \nhopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation . \nfans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i\'m sure . \ni stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i\'m asking myself why . \nmovies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i\'m going to do now . \ngo spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap . \ndon\'t go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death . \n-- curtis edmonds \n "" no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it .

0,"b""the sequel to the fugitive ( 1993 ) , u . s marshals is an average thriller using it's association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks . \ntommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard , the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive . \nthis time , he's after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents , but of course he's been set up , and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes , he makes a run for it , gerard not so hot on his tail . \nwhat follows is about 2 hours of action , brought to us by the director of executive decision ( 1995 ) , another film curiously involving a plane . \nwhen comparing this movie to the fugitive , the prequel is far superior . \nbut even on it's own , u . s marshals is a pretty lousy movie . \nwhile the original was reasonably intelligent , and had a fugitive to root for , the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film's overlong running time . \nwhile the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character , u . s marshals is straight in there , pulling it's trump card ( the place crash ) almost immediately . \nto be honest , i couldn't care less if snipe's character got captured or not . \nsnipes performance is average , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive ) for reasons i'll explain later . \ntommy lee jones is as fine as ever , although his role is hardly a challenge . \nthe sense of deja vu was overwhelming . \ni know it's the same role from the fugitive , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film . \nthere's a few 'nudge nudge' references from the first film , but apart from that , nothing . \nnobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie . \ndowney jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who's roped into the chase , and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife . \nnobody looks as if their having a good time , and all the performers are on autopilot . \nthe supporting cast are o . k , but when it comes to performances , u . s marshals falls flat on it's face . \nit doesn't fare any better plot-wise , either . \nthe film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes , but then veers off into terrorists territory . \nas said above , the film is an normal , average terrorist thriller , seen a million times before , but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional . \nif this film wasn't the 'sequel' to the fugitive , this would probably go straight to video , or not even been made at all , because it's so average . \nand because of the film's plot changing it's course , snipes is almost forgotten apart , and hardly features in the movie . \nstuart baird , the director , is all right , but there's no particular scene that stands out . \nit's director is the usual action movie style . \neven the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension . \nthe special effects are nice , especially the plane crash , and there's a good ( if very loud ) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith . \nbut in the end , u . s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement . \nsure , it's loud and dumb , but in the end u . s marshals just ain't fun . \nbored performers and a lackluster plot and script , do not make a good action movie . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities \n"""
1,"b'it has happened again . \na movie that is well scripted , well acted , and well directed . \nit is involving , suspenseful . . . \nit even has an unexpected twist at the end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus . \nbut in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie . \nthe sixth sense is that movie . \nstarring bruce willis ( armageddon ) as a child psychologist and haley joel osment ( forrest gump ) as a troubled youngster , the sixth sense is more spooky than scary , though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle . \neight-year-old cole sear ( osment ) sees dead people . \nnot just in dreams . \nand not just as lifeless bodies . \nhe sees them walking around like regular people . \nand he sees them all the time . \ndr . malcolm crowe ( willis ) is trying to help him . \nhe recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom crowe failed , resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself . \nif crowe could manage to find a way to help cole , he believes he just might be able to put his own demons to rest . \nbut first he needs to gain cole\'s trust . \nthe boy is so frightened by what he sees , he has closed himself off emotionally , being unwilling to tell anyone . . . \nnot crowe , not even his own mother ( toni collette , clockwatchers ) . . . \nabout his "" secrets . "" \ncrowe begins to spend more and more time with him , even as his own marriage starts to dissolve around him , his wife anna ( olivia williams , rushmore ) becoming cold and distant because of his neglect of her and his preoccupation with the boy . \nbruce willis underplays his role , allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character development . \ncrowe moves from treating a troubled boy who won\'t communicate , to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations , to wondering if perhaps there isn\'t some truth behind what the boy sees . \nmr . willis does a serviceable job , letting the focus remain on the story instead of on his familiar action hero screen persona . \neleven-year-old haley joel osment manages to impress us with his performance . \nhe demonstrates an amazing amount of self-composure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a seasoned pro . \nit is fine work for one of such a tender age . \nkeep your eye on this young man . \nthe supporting cast is also quite effective . \ntoni collette , as the confused , frightened , and frustrated mother who can\'t understand what is happening to her child ; olivia williams , as crowe\'s once loving wife who is shutting down emotionally due to the lack of attention from her husband ; and donnie wahlberg ( ransom ) as crowe\'s ex-patient , now grown , who illustrates his doctor\'s failure to help him in the most vivid terms imaginable . \ntwenty-eight year old m . night shyamalan ( wide awake ) directed his own script , maintaining a proper tension throughout the film and crafting the storytelling so expertly that the film\'s full impact is not reached until its final moments , when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of all that preceded it . \nit is a rare movie which manages to pull that off and mr . shyamalan , as the one responsible , is certainly to be commended . \nin giving the sixth sense a favorable "" three star "" review for its craftsmanship and artistic merit , i must also point out that , spiritually speaking , the film is highly misleading . \nthere is no scriptural foundation upon which to base a belief in ghosts or the "" living dead . "" \nthe concept of death being a doorway to another plane of existence is a devilish lie that has been around as long as man himself . \nthe first lie recorded in the bible was devised by the serpent who assured eve , "" thou shall not surely die , "" a direct contradiction of god\'s admonition . \nthat same lie has been perpetuated ad infinitum throughout the ages . \nscriptures do speak of a time when the dead shall rise but that wonderful demonstration of victory over death will not commence until after the second coming of christ . . . \nan event which has not yet occurred . \ntherefore , the dead remain in a state of oblivion , having no consciousness , until that long-awaited time when the final trump shall sound . \nand then , you\'ll need six senses to register all the joy and rejoicing that will resound throughout the heavens . \n'"
0,"b""mr . bean , a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting . \nthe first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la , but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride . \nheck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick . \neither way look out america bean is coming . \nwell , what can really be said about this movie , there is very little discernible plot . \nthat much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy . \nit achieves that goal rather admirably , but because it is that , the plot is just screaming for help . \nthe whole premise that the movie is based on is to say the least flawed . \nthe movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went . \ndon't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece . \nbut if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie , even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid . \nthe movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims , or so it seems . \nnow when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things , first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner . \nwell , there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure . \ni have to concede that mr . atkinson's acting in this movie is well done . \nalthough the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is . \ni think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue , it would have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie . \nnow the rest of the actors in the movie , bad acting and poor casting . \ni think that the role opposite bean could have been better , just seemed wrong for the movie . \na different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved . \none thing that i must say , simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results . \ntv shows should do just that stay on tv , it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers . \ni can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively , the best known of those would have to be star trek . \nbean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved . \nnow another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly . \nthe form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people , these people will think like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless . \nbut if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie . \nbut to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie . \nthere are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one . \n"""

0,"b' "" the beach "" is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder . \nevery forty minutes of this two-hour film begins with a new theme , virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act . \nit starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment . \nbut then in the second act , the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of "" blue lagoon "" . \nforty minutes later , the mood changes once more , and it becomes a dumbed down version of "" lord of the flies "" where an isolated community is discovered , where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs . \nby the time it\'s over , you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about . \nthe main character of "" the beach "" is angst-ridden richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) . \nhe travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you\'re looking for a good time . \nrichard\'s voice-over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown . \nthis seedy environment is just what richard is looking for . \nhe checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy ( robert carlisle ) . \nhe seems like a raving lunatic , obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis . \nthough his jagged behavior would distress most of us , richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen . \nmoreover , the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life . \ncaptivated by the idea , he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey . \nthey are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise , who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richard\'s . \nonce they finally arrive at this paradise , however , the mood of the story shifts to richard\'s growing desire for francoise . \nthis particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard . \netienne is about as exciting as fluffy , white sand . \nit\'s odd that etienne never sees this coming , but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view . \nand once the three stumble across the hidden community ( mood shift imminent ) , more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers . \nfor example , there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards . \nand the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark . \nthere are several ideas that are introduced in "" the beach "" and each one could merit its own feature-length film . \nthere\'s the man vs . nature angle , the love triangle angle , and the utopia-gone-awry angle . \nbut the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred . \ndicaprio , as a result , has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through . \nconsequently , the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up . \n'"

1,"b""one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable . \nyou know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is . \nsure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch . \nthis cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun . \none of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story . \nthis rule applies highly to kiss the girls . \nthere is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made . \nhowever , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through . \nwell , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up . \nunfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits . \nthat may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery . \nhowever , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film . \nplotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality . \nwe are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero . \nhe gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself . \nobviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene . \nat his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days . \nthis provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross . \nhowever , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees . . . \nbefore she is abducted . \ndr . kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself . \nbecause of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful . \nafter being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods . \nremembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out . \nwhen casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall . \nafter she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice . \nfrom this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive . \nmany people will compare this film to 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional . \nthe screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form . \nwhat makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness . \nthe cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us . \nsometimes a simple shot is the best one . \nhowever , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight . \nthe scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way . \nthe camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well . \nthe chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd's character is experiencing . \nhowever , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors . \nmorgan freeman is one of today's most powerful and believable actors . \ndetective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven . \nbecause of freeman's powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself . \nthe other half is carried by ashley judd , one of today's most promising dramatic actresses . \nin fact , her performance is better than freeman's , if that is even possible . \nher character is more original than freeman's , and she handles it wonderfully . \nwe finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream . \nthe supporting cast is highly underdeveloped , but the cast members do as much as they can with it . \ncary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina , and unfortunately has scraps for a character . \ntony goldwyn fairs slightly better , but we don't really get to know his character either . \ngina ravera gives a good performance , but again she isn't in many of the scenes . \nso as a result of all these small supporting parts , the weight of the film lies on the two leads , and they do a phenomenal job . \nsome of the best acting of this genre , and some of the best acting of the year . \ntwo other essential aspects of the film are quite good . \ndirector gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors , but the second half of the film loses believability , especially during the revelation of the killer . \nhe also doesn't handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have , losing a lot of tension during many scenes . \nhowever , to his credit , he does manage a terrific first half . \npart of the blame falls on david klass . \ni'm sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more , but klass focuses on the two main parts . \nwhile this may give the two leads more screentime , many of the small characters are one-dimensional , and the killer , when revealed , is extremely implausible . \nthanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel , kiss the girls always seems intelligent . \nnone of the conversations are laughable , and all move the plot forward without seeming forced . \none of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer . \ni blame this mainly on the casting director , because the killer's motive is because of rejection from women ( or so i assume from the opening monologue ) , but the killer himself is very attractive ( one of my friends is a , shall we say , big admirer of the killer ) . \nkiss the girls is rated r for terror , violence , language , and suggested sex . \nwith all the implausibilities of this film , and with the mediocre second half , kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain . \nin fact , i had the urge to see it again just for the performances . \nthe cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone , and the script is usually smart . \nthis is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through . \nmorgan freeman is possibly today's most convincing actor , and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt . \ni must also say that i loved the ending . \nthe

"" \nwell , the quartet of chums - jim ( jason biggs ) , oz ( chris klein ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) - have grown up . \nat least they are a year older , but don\'t seem any wiser . \nfresh from their first year of college the quartet , along with the obnoxious stifler ( seann william scott ) , rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score . \nas usual nothing goes right until the last reel . \nbut what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women . \nand american pie 2 is rather degrading to women . \nfor the most part , they are not shown as individuals . \nthey are nothing more than potential recipients of over-active , raging hormones . \nit is telling that the most normal couple , oz and heather ( mena suvari ) spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex - she\'s overseas on an exchange student program . \ndespite having been to college , jim is still klutzy and awkward , unsure of himself around the opposite sex . \nmost of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him , including a painful episode involving an instant glue-like substance . \nalso uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates , whom the boys suspect of being lesbians . \nit is offensive and plays upon outdated , adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs . \nthe first film , despite some raunchy moments , had an innocent charm to it . \nthe sequel is more cynical . \nit knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them : the many mentions of finch\'s encounter with stifler\'s mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy\'s return as jim\'s well-meaning , trying-to-be-hip dad . \nthe only performer who is actually given some new , fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle , the band geek from the original . \nin the sequel , she imbues her character with vulnerability , wisdom and maturity . \namerican pie 2 is a pre-sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office . \nit is a shame , though , that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz , who also penned the original , could not have set his sights higher . \namerican pie 2 is funny , but it\'s still a comedown as well as a letdown . \n'"
1,"b'richard gere is not one of my favorite actors . \nhowever , i like courtroom dramas , and this film looked good enough to take a chance on . \ni wasn\'t disappointed . \nit wasn\'t a great film , but it was interesting , and took several unexpected turns . \none thing : what\'s with the title ? \nnot only is it extremely forgettable , it doesn\'t really have much to do with the film , as far as i could determine . \nin the long run , it will probably hurt the film , as people won\'t be able to think of or remember it . \nmartin vail ( richard gere ) is a grandiose defense attorney . \nhe loves the money and the fame that go along with defending ( successfully ) rich scum , such as mafia men and drug-dealers . \nonce he sees that the accused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby-faced alter boy , he wants in on the case , presumably for the press he\'ll get . \nwe soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover , janet venable ( laura linney ) . \nvail himself is a former prosecutor , and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney , played very well by john mahoney ( frasier\'s father on the tv series ) . \nthere is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie : people have public faces , and private faces . \nwe see this in the murdered archbishop , in the accused , and , most strongly , defense attorney martin vail . \nrichard gere does a fairly good job . \nat first , he appears to be a money- and attention-grabbing lawyer , with no consideration of the truth . \nbut we see another side , as he becomes a seeker of justice , and comes to believe in his client . \nalfre woodard , as the judge , is capable , though somewhat wasted in a standard role . \nlaura linney also does journeyman work ; nothing spectacular , but acceptable . \nher relationship with vail is believable ; their verbal fencing adds to the film . \nthe actor who playes vail\'s investigator ( unfortunately , i don\'t remember his name ) is quite good . \nhis female assistant ( she looked very familiar , but i can\'t remember where i\'ve seen her ) was also capable , but unspectacular . \nthe best performance in the film was by edward norton . \nhe was excellent , as the timid altar-boy turned alleged "" butcher boy of st . mike\'s "" . \ni was impressed by the depth of the plot ; there are red-herrings , and dead-ends , that in a lesser film would lead to a predictable ending . \ni liked the plot twists the film took , and most of the supporting characters , thus i give primal fear a respectable b+ rating . \n'"
0,"b'if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films , i might say that i review movies that don\'t look particularly good because i\'m doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it . \nif that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : "" shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don\'t have to .

"" \nthe crew includes captain a . j . \nmarley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz ) . \nthere are some attempts at "" characterization , "" but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female ) . \ndon\'t expect any more explanation , because you won\'t get it . \nanyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent . \nduring the dimension jump ( i think that\'s what it\'s called , but don\'t hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board . \nhe calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with . \nthen a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening . \nhave you seen "" alien ? "" \nhave you seen "" event horizon "" ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? \ngood . \nthen you\'ve seen "" supernova . "" \npost-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either . \nafter all , no one\'s going to think for a second that troy won\'t turn out to be a villain . \nbut the bigger problem with "" supernova "" is that it can\' t just stick to the simple plot it\'s afforded . \nnumerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it\'s a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped . \nwas there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ? \ndid the ship\'s computer learn something about humanity ? \nwhat was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? \nand just what does the film\'s title signify , if anything ? \nas far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn\'t developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements . \ncharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense . \nfor some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex . \nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes . \nbassett and spader\'s characters start off hating each other . \nfifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they\'re engaging in some hanky-panky . \nwhen troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him . \nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut . \nthe most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! \nfurthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits . \nmaybe that\'s why the film\'s title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster . \nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you\'re seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations . \nthe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby . \npoint b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing . \ndoesn\'t make sense . \nsince i didn\'t understand anything about these characters\' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? \nnot a whit . \nit\'s a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do . \nthey don\'t find it . \nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces . \nsexual tension ? \nmore like constipation . \nmaybe they\'re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as "" this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . "" \nnot that we ever find out who that is , mind you . \nthe climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film\'s biggest forehead-slapper . \nas troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected . \nhe\' s awfully one-note , but it\'s not as if he\'s given any more notes to work with . \nthe rest of the cast does even less . \ntunney stands around looking cute , then scared . \nphillips broods . \ncruz flirts with the computer . \nthen they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn\'t paying much attention by then . \n "" supernova "" is pretty awful , but i\'m cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . \nthat\'s it . \nif you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you\'ll probably hate it more than i will . \neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven\' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn\'t going to save the film . \nhonestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ? \nit usually results in a bad movie , and that\'s what "" supernova "" is . \n'"

0,"b""keep cool , a chinese film directed by semi-accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang , was one of the kickoff films for this year's hawaii international film festival . \non the day it premiered , lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block , some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater . \nthey need not have wasted their time . \nthe movie is billed as a comedy , but is surprisingly bereft of humor . \nthere are noticeable attempts at laughs , but very few tries actually click . \ni wondered if there were jokes that i wasn't getting because i'm not from china , but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn't be attributed to the cultural barrier either . \nkeep cool just isn't very funny . \nthe prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool's producer who , with the help of an interpreter , regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time , an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii . \nalthough the print made it , the assistant's luggage was lost . \ntoo bad that story wasn't in the movie , because it got a big laugh . \nqu ying , the film's female lead , was also on hand to give a few comments . \nhowever , whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed , ms . ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one , fast-paced , incredibly long tirade . \nit was dizzying ; good foreshadowing for the film . \nyou see , keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes . \nat least that's the way it seems , since the camera is constantly moving . \ncinema verite is one thing , but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another . \nalthough some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing , i found it thoroughly distracting , and after a while , quite annoying . \nheadache , as i said . \nthe film is about a young bookseller ( wen jiang ) who is after a young woman ( qu ying ) . \nthey used to be romantically involved , but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship . \nthe first half of the film is about the young man's plan to win her back . \nof course the thing is , she doesn't want to be won back , and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit . \nin the fight , the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker , but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost . \nwe later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced . \nthere is a funny scene ( the only one in the film ) where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner ( baotian li ) in order to recoup his losses . \nthere is no sense to be made out of the young woman's behavior ; cold one minute , caring the next , so we feel no sympathy for her character . \nthe bookseller would be better off without her . \nalthough the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well , who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner's hand as revenge for the beating he took , it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man . \nwhile the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge , the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation . \nhis quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with , but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time . \na friendship develops between the two men , but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate . \nalthough only an hour and a half in length , keep cool contains extraneous material . \nthe whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out , since we don't see her from the midpoint on . \na case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner , and would have saved us from the bookseller's boring pursuit during the first half . \nbut of course , this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour . \nthere are a few things that keep cool does right . \nas mentioned before , the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good . \nalthough it grows tiresome , the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic , and represents the differences in thinking between generations . \nin one scene , for example , the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across , but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted , and that it means something entirely different . \nalso effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene , such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner . \nthe nightclub owner is counting out money , slapping each bundle of currency on the table . \nwith every shot of his hand , we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge . \nunfortunately , these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film's shortcomings , and weren't enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater . \n"""

1,"b'many people dislike french films for their lack of closure . \nwhile possibly shallow , i\'ve often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view . \nthere is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) . \nstephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker . \nhe is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing . \neven the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches . \nin the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man . \ncamille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes . \nmaxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife . \nlike stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges . \nwhen stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals . \nhowever , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him . \nstephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present . \nas the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another . \nthese two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently . \nstephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship . \nhowever , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation . \nthe audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher . \nhowever , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing . \nconsequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays . \nin contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier . \nhowever , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world\'s finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing . \nduring the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions . \nstephane attempts to remain unchanged . \nhowever , we do see subtle hints of his transformation . \none of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash . \nthe development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible . \namerican movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development . \nin its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane . \nthe portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille\'s and stepahne\'s characters . \ni am not sure why berardinelli says , "" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil\'s credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . "" \nthis movie is not about judging stephane\'s actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are . \ni find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling . \nthis portion of the film is where the "" sense of closure "" could have been successfully accomplished . \nunfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters . \nwhile ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film . \nthe synergism of the tension of ravel\'s music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen . \nthe directing in this movie is wonderful . \nthe actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth . \nemmanuelle beart\'s personality is beautiful . \nand needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful . \nbesides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral . \ni almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of . \nthe one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ? \ni have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing . \nin summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship . \nin the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people . \nin itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie . \nwhere it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people . \ni do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture . \nhowever , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film . \ni would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it . \n'"
0,"b'my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love . \ni love ralph fiennes . \ni love uma thurman . \ni love sean connery . \nhell , i\'m even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw . \ni saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i\'ve been eagerly awaiting the film ever since . \na few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground . \nthen , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics . \nand that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs . \nand that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique . \nmy expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things . \nthe film i saw today didn\'t even meet those expectations . \nthis is a lousy , incoherent mess . \ni would slam it harder , if it weren\'t for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors . \nbut sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired . \nthat\'s the main problem with the avengers : for all it\'s hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired . \nit\'s like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making . \nit also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots . \nthis is just plain depressing . \nthe avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show . \nfrequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i\'ve never watched an episode . \ni wasn\'t alive then . \ni don\'t even watch television now . \ni\'m very sorry that i don\'t have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i\'ve already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse . \ni didn\'t know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles . \ni also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film . \nbased on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits . \nthey are to work together , under mother\'s orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw ) . \nit seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather . \nhis name is de wynter ( connery ) . \nhe is a crazy scottish guy . \nour heroes had better stop him , or else . \n . \n . \nthe weather will keep getting colder until they "" have to go to hell to warm up "" ( one of the film\'s few funny lines ) . \nalong the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense . \nfor example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos . \nnow , killer bugs don\'t really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film . \nthe purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established . \nthey\'re never even directly connected to de wynter ( they\'re controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) . \nthe special effects aren\'t bad , but they\'re loud , obnoxious , and intrusive . \nlike so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning . \nand i guarantee you , it will wane . \ni stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn\'t do any good to think . \nthe avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn\'t tell us what happens . \nthere are several scenes in the preview that didn\'t make the final cut . \nin addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) . \nthe scenes that don\'t feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast . \nthey aren\'t . \nthe action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film . \nthey aren\'t , either . \nand what about this wasted cast ? \noh , it makes me weep with disappointment . \nwe\'re talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * . \ni love the guy . \ni\'ve loved all his films , until this one . \nhe seems like he wants to understand the film , but he\'s as lost as we are . \nand thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can\'t manage to look at home here . \n ( i don\'t blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can\'t be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . ) \nconnery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter . \nwho is to blame ? \nis it the screenwriter , don macpherson ? \nperhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right . \nis it the actors ? \nfor god\'s sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling . \ni blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn\'t have been given the task to begin with . \nhis best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor . \nadd to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory . \nif the avengers has a saving grace , it\'s the set design . \nthe sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at . \ni like the final set-piece , on de wynter\'s island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense . \ni admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere . \ni also enjoyed michael kamen\'s music score , particularly in the opening credits . \nbut this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there\'s a lot more that needs to be here . \ninspiration , for instance , would have been really nice . \nmaybe a little bit of cohesion in the story . \nor a sense of purpose . \nmost of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles . \ndamn this movie for not giving them the chance . \n'"
1,"b""wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon , denise richards , and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex , love , murder , and betrayal . \nthe setting of the film is a town named blue bay . \nit consists of many swamps and slums and , on the other hand , rich estates owned by the town's different benefactors . \nthe film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town's ritzy , expensive high school . \nit is here that we meet all of the core characters . \nthere's guidance counselor sam lombardo , police officers ray duquette and gloria perez , dark mysterious senior suzie toller , and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan . \nwe first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor , but none more than kelly . \nthroughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape . \nshortly after , suzie , too , confesses that sam raped her as well . \nthis pushes kelly's sex craving mother , sandra , to stop at nothing until sam is convicted . \nduring the trial , kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her . \nhowever , it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls , it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor . \nafter sam is cleared , kelly's mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her . \nit is then revealed that sam , kelly , and suzie were all in on it together . \nit is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda . \nmatt dillon stars as sam lombardo . \nsam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into , and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage . \nhe isn't the obvious best of actors , but dillon does give a convincing performance . \nhowever , his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film , making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles , although he never had many to start out with in the first place . \nneve campbell , who most people relate to scream and scream 2 , plays blue bay outcast suzie toller . \nsuzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film . \ncampbell is very successful with this character , adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch . \nplaying kelly van ryan is denise richards . \nkelly is your typical , rich , sexy , head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses , like her sexpot mother sandra . \none of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother . \ndenise richards , still hot off the press from starship troopers , gives the most interesting performance in the entire film . \nin the beginning , kelly looks to be a paper thin character , but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy , but dominating as well . \nkevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette . \nthis character looks to be one of the most boring , predictable in the film . \nhowever , it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story . \nstill , the film doesn't seem to gain much from bacon's performance , only his name . \nin the supporting cast , theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan , daphne rubin-vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez , and bill murray shines as sam's lawyer , ken bowden . \nhats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film . \nalthough wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller , the eroticism , which is portrayed with good taste , is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters . \nthis is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it's share of twists . \n"""
1,"b'the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate . \npeople are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future . \nafter a sort of confusing bit involving fake-looking cyborg things , the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds . \nthe basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while ( make that every 1000 years or so ) an evil force comes to destroy earth . \nthe things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element . \nthe plot in this movie really isn\'t that important to the thing though . \nthis movie has very good special effects , for the most part . \nthe techno-ish music in the background fits the mood very well . \nbruce willis is an illegal taxi-cab driver in a futuristic new york city . \none day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk . \nthis movie is about what happens . \nthe plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations . \nalso there is a fair bit of action in the film , particularly towards the end . \nsome characters are just plain strange including a highly-energetic deejay in drag . \nbruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does . \nthe movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down . \nit is one of those sci-fi films where you\'ll be saying "" cool "" followed by a "" what the hell ? ! ? !

0,"b'they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movie\'s poster : "" no sequel . "" \nscary movie 2 is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor , and it is not because the wayans brothers , shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera , don\'t try . \nwhat defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof . \nthe first movie - an outrageous , low-brow , savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what you did last summer - succeeded because of its take-no-prisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue , familiar and popular . \nin scary movie 2 , the filmmakers take on the haunted house-ghost story format which , if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill , did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series . \nscary movie 2 does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist , featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn . \nof course split pea soup is the punch line - an overabundant amount , which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive . \nbut this pre-credit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action , which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university class project . \nsome of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original , but they lack that take-no-prisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque . \nscary movie 2 merely lurches from one lame sendup to another , offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball , and the films what lies beneath and hannibal ( features that only faired adequately at the box office ) , john woo\'s mission : impossible 2 and charlie\'s angels . \nit is as if the wayans and their team of writers - at least seven are credited - just threw ideas in a blender and hoped they\'d coalesce . \nthey don\'t . \nwhile the pace of the original left you breathless , the sequel moves with the speed of an 18-wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up a steep mountain road . \nyou can almost hear the reels panting . \nscary movie 2 tries very hard to live up to its original , but it falls very short . \nit\'s a dissatisfying spectacle , a very weak sister of a very good movie . \nthe really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is . \n'"

1,"b'you know you\'re in for a truly different cinematic experience the moment you realize steve buscemi has been cast as the movie in question\'s most normal character . \nsuch is the case with "" the big lebowski , "" joel and ethan coen\'s first venture since their "" fargo "" nabbed nationwide acclaim and a mantlepiece of academy award nods . \nthere\'s no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment , because "" lebowski "" is an effort that makes words like "" strange "" and "" unusual "" seem like an understatement . \nthanks in part to delicious characterization and an all-encompassing sense of humor , the film is a smashing success . \nthe central oddball here is the dude ( jeff bridges ) , an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot , drinking beer and going bowling ( are you college students already rooting for him , or what ? ) . \none night , a pair of thugs break into his house and pee on his carpet , a threatening act that\'s supposed to be carried out against a famous pasadena millionaire ( david huddleston ) who shares his birth name -- jeff lebowski -- with the dude . \nonce the dude realizes this coincidence , he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug , and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter ( john goodman ) , a hotheaded vietnam vet , and donny ( buscemi ) , a mild-mannered surfer , before too long . \nsoon , though , lebowski\'s trampy trophy wife bunny ( tara reid ) is kidnaped and held for a hefty ransom , and he turns to the dude for help . \nit seems bunny\'s troubles are related to a line of work she\'s kept secret from her husband -- she\'s actually an adult film star and is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn . \nthe dude , now on lebowski\'s payroll , accepts the offer and agrees to handle the money drop ; walter tags along and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself . \nchaos obviously ensues , and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops , crooks and lebowski\'s ultra-eccentric artist daughter maude ( julianne moore ) . \n "" the big lebowski "" deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that "" fargo "" did ; while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film , "" lebowski "" is at least as breathtakingly imaginative . \nthe movie boasts a mile-high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over , but thankfully never does . \nthe coens ( joel directed , ethan produced and both wrote ) keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale , and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick . \nwhether we\'re watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeley-esque dream sequence , "" the big lebowski "" is immensely lively . \nthere are those who will dislike this film , but not because it\'s boring . \nthe cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they\'re given . \nbridges exudes a likeable , surprisingly sweet presence ; his dude sure isn\'t the cleanest guy around , but you\'d still follow him to another movie . \ngoodman merits 1998\'s first oscar consideration , as walter\'s manic temper is one of "" the big lebowski "" \'s many highlights ; the same goes for moore , whose throaty , delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot . \njohn turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction . \nsam elliott\'s rambling narration gets the film off to a solid start . \nand some will recognize peter stormare -- "" fargo "" \'s silent heavy -- as carl hungus , a porn star who\'s really a samurai sword-wielding german nihilist and has-been pop star . \nonly in its final third does the movie falter , with a couple of loose plot threads and some cast members who quickly disappear and never emerge for a curtain call . \nthese flaws are forgivable , though -- the coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality that it\'s hard to look at the final product with anything but a big grin on your face . \nwithout a doubt , "" the big lebowski "" is the best film so far this year . \nsure , we\'re only three months in and the competition ( "" deep rising , "" "" desperate measures , "" "" the wedding singer , "" etc . ) has been pretty bland , but it\'s still the gospel truth . \nmaybe during next awards season , "" lebowski "" won\'t be a far cry from "" fargo .

1,"b'i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files . \nfirst , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . \nthe producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . \nyou have to reach for a larger audience . \ntherefore , the movie is quite user-friendly . \naltough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . \nbut fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . \nyou will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . \nin any case , the answer is no . \ni am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . \nhowever , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie\'s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . \ni taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . \neverything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . \ni know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . \nwarning : major spoilers follow ! \nplease do not read to fully enjoy this movie , you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about . \nyou have been warned . \nthe x-files is what a summer should be . \nexciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . \nthis is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . \nfrom start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . \nwhen i compare it with last summer\'s movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . \nthis flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . \nin fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . \nyou might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! \nthe last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . \nyou know , when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? \nso yeah , the x-files is scary . \nand guess what ? \nyou never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . \ndo not think that the x-files is a monster movie . \nin fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . \nno , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . \nscully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . \nshe has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . \nno , this is mulder\'s time in the spotlight . \nby now , you have heard of the scene where mulder "" showers "" independence day . \nif you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let\'s just say that due to recent events mulder should be "" showering "" godzilla instead . \nto those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who \ncares ! ? \nif he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? \nthe dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . \nthe camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . \nthe script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . \nif you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! \nunlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . \nmiss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . \nalso , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don\'t ! \nthe person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . \nthere is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? \n ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . \nwho needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a "" big emotional scene "" between godzilla attacks ? \nso far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i\'d recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . \nbut the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is . \nwhat more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? \ncool effects ? \nit\'s got some . \npulse pounding ? \nhell yes ! \nstrangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time . \nit does not provide answers to the show\'s many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . \nrating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many "" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! "" \nmoments , four "" holy shit , where the hell did that come from "" and one heck of an ending . \nyou may wonder where this movie lost half a star . \nwell , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . \nit\'s pretty obvious the film\'s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving . \n'"

"" \nas i watched "" session 9 "" i became aware of the subtle things that built up during the story that make it a true horror movie . \nthe striking high-definition video camera work by uta briesewitz ( who worked with the director , brad anderson , on his "" next stop wonderland "" ) helps to build up tension with close-ups , fluid camera movement and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud . \nmusic , too , is used to intense effect , joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening , even horrifying . \ncouple these tech feats with an intelligent story that uses elements of "" the shining , "" "" the blair witch project "" and , even "" the texas chainsaw massacre "" and you get a decent , intriguing horror flick . \nadditionally , the brilliant decision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character , the institution itself , which lends even more chills to the equation . \nacting is another factor that raises "" session 9 "" above the usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like "" scream , "" "" i know what you did last summer "" and their sequels . \nthose films took good-looking , though generic , young actors and actresses and put them to use to build up a body count , substituting mayhem for real horror . \nanderson opted , instead , to use mature , experienced actors like peter mullan and david caruso to fill his characters\' shoes and the difference in casting quality is notable . \nmullan , in particular , puts an arc on his character , gordon , as the troubled guy who slowly and inexorably falls under the pressures of family , job and , finally , danvers state hospital . \nthe rest of the small cast fit the bill as people , not just fodder for the mayhem . \ndavid caruso , as gordo\'s senior man and near equal in the business , shows just how good an actor he is . \nhe made the jump from tv\'s "" nypd blue "" to film far too soon and his decisions in the roles he took ( i\'ll never forget the horrendous "" jade "" ) were less than star making . \nhe rolls his sleeves up and does the job well here . \ngevedon , lucas and sexton are more than fodder , too . \nthe only problem with "" session 9 "" lay in the uninspired ending . \nit takes on a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground and is a bit of a disappointment after the terrific ( and inspired ) build up . \nthe pleasure is getting there and i wish that anderson and gevedon had kept up the steam they had so ably built during the bulk of the film \n "" session 9 "" is an unusual feat . \nit is scary , doesn\'t use cheap tricks and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered , subtle horror . \nbecause of the local interest of danvers , it should do well with the northeast crowd . \ni hope it gets the national distribution it deserves . \ni give it a b+ . \n'"
0,"b""an american werewolf in london is john landis' groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england . \nthe groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects . \nmore specifically , the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character . \neven twenty years after its release , that part of the movie is still impressive . \nalthough , i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive . \nthe rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure . \nif it weren't for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980 . \nand with good reason -- the acting isn't great and neither is the writing . \nwell ok , we don't actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film . \nbut one other important element is lacking here too -- it isn't scary . \nwith no exception , you know what is going to happen before it happens . \nyou don't even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint . \ni will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen . \nbut john , it just wasn't scary . \ni didn't know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it , but it didn't work for me . \nactually , it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films . \nbut the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me . \nit's never a good sign that you don't realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material . \ncall me crazy , but you shouldn't have to do research on a movie to enjoy it . \ni'm not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much , since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up . \nwerewolf bites boy ( david naughton ) . \nboy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse ( jenny agutter ) and then strange things begin to happen to boy . \nincluding , and i must admit this is a very nice touch , visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital . \nthe neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse . \ni know it sounds strange , but it actually works . \nthe scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy ( griffin dunne ) are really the best parts of the movie . \nas i said , probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects . \nwhile they are still impressive today , they aren't impressive enough , or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film . \nand since they are more or less the highlight of the film , there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch . \nactually , the 1998 sequel , an american werewolf in paris , is more entertaining since it doesn't take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way . \n"""
0,"b'\'bicentennial man\' is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment . \nchris columbus , the director who gave you "" mrs . doubtfire "" , plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point . \nbased on the short story by isaac asimov , it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human , which as you can imagine is very difficult . \nstarting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children . \nsoon this robot , called andrew ( robin williams ) shows abilities that makes his owner mr . martin ( sam neill ) very curious . \nandrew is interested in art and music , he "" enjoys "" making clocks , which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions . \nit shows out that because of a small failure in the "" electrical circuits "" and "" positronic brain "" andrew has accidentally gained a soul . \nthis makes him unique and his evil creators worried . \nthen mr . martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn\'t programmed to do . \nsoon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom , destiny and love . \nthis film can be described as a disney version of blade runner , a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction . \never since that film , the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy . \nwhat makes us human ? \nthe thoughts ? \nthe emotions ? \nis it possible to become human ? \nat what point can we say to a robot "" now you are one of us "" ? \nthese are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach . \nit is obvious that columbus didn\'t take them very seriously . \nwhen you think about it , this film is not really meditating on the question "" when is a robot no longer a machine , but a human being ? "" , but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding . \nandrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being , and only the society has troubles with it . \nin other words , it is as far from reality as from the academy awards . \nfurther more , there are other annoying problems . \nto this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now . \nthis has not been done for obvious reasons , because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task . \ncolumbus is the first to have crossed that line . \nthe result is , as you might imagine , primitive , unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort . \nthe world is simply frozen in time . \nneither the society , fashion , culture or values have changed over 200 years . \nmom is still working at the kitchen , doing the dishes . \nwhen you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today , you\'ll see a slightly bigger difference . \ni am not saying that everything should change . \nit is unlikely that the human rights will change , but it\'s even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science , technology and fashion . \ni suppose it\'s possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale , but it\'s really hard . \nrobin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way . \nas always he does a decent job , as does sam neill . \nbut it doesn\'t really matter . \nit is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience . \npretty much like last year\'s "" meet joe black "" , this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesn\'t deserve . \ngreat actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten . \nwhen isaac asimov wrote this story , the future seemed far away and magical . \neverything seemed possible . \nnow is the future of asimov\'s time , and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago . \nfor the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne\'s "" 20 000 leagues under the sea "" , so can\'t we accept this story as a potential reality . \nlet us hope that next year\'s "" a . i .

1,"b'film adaptation of hunter s . thompson\'s infamous semi-autobiographical hallucinogen-fueled book of the same title . \ndirector terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8/10 ) and brazil ( 7/10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7 . 5/10 ) ) \n "" apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie "" , according to gilliam . \nplot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr . gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race . \nduring their trip , they systematically consume "" two bags of grass , seventy-five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half-full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls . \nthe movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use . \ncritique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer\'s own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess . \nif you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels . \nif , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug-induced picture\'s entire ride ( 5 . 5/10 for all those sober dogs ) . \nnote : i have not read thompson\'s book . \nhaving said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol-based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level . \nthis movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot . \nit moves admirably from one scene to the next , without much basis of their being , while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s . thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine . \nit was 1971 , and the times were apparently "" a\' changing "" in the states . \njohnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop . \nduring the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real-life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole . \ni thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much , but then again , this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything , so who am i to talk . \nthe one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr . gonzo . \ni couldn\'t believe that this fat , samoan lawyer , was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects ( 7 . 5/10 ) . \nword on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role , and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible . \nplenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin , christina ricci , tobey maguire and cameron diaz , along with a bunch of others . \nother than that , the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic , the style was not as wild as i thought it would be , and the ending was certainly not much of a barn-burner , but then again , who really noticed . \nthis movie is about visions of bats floating through your head , johnny depp looking goofy and being bald , and the cornucopia of drug-ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy , rebellion and the lost american dream . \nand for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie , i suggest you move further down the aisle , buy yourself a ticket to godzilla ( 6/10 ) , and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind . \nlittle known facts : depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine . \nbill murray also portrayed a thompson-based character in the film where the buffalo roam . \njohnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers , speed ( 7 . 5/10 ) , and legends of the fall ( 7 . 5/10 ) , for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon ( 6 . 5/10 ) and what\'s eating gilbert grape ? \n ( 7/10 ) . \nin 1988 , depp told rolling stone magazine that he\'d tried every drug by the age of 14 . \njohnny hung out with some of the members of oasis while filming the uncompleted divine rapture in ireland , and later played some slide guitar on the 1997 album , be here now . \njohnny was born in kentucky , is a high-school dropout , has nicknamed himself "" mr . stench "" , has been engaged to four women until now ( including actress winona ryder , whose "" winona forever "" tattoo had to be altered to "" wino forever "" after their breakup ) , currently plays guitar in a band called "" p "" , and owns the viper room nightclub in l . a . \n'"
0,"b'capsule : the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies , dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension . \nalien 3 ( the "" 3 "" should be in superscript ) is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen . \nit continues the story of ripley , the space-trucker-turned-impromptu-survivalist , but seems remarkably uninterested in her . \nin fact , the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all , it\'s so elegaic and limp . \na little of this would have been nice for atmosphere , but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning . \nat the end of the last film ( aliens ) , ripley and two survivors were on their way home . \nunfortunately , an alien pod had been deposited in their ship , and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod . \nthe pod crashes on firorina 161 , a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent . \nripley lives through the crash ; the others do not . \nthe prison is a grim place , even as prisons go -- it\'s been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks , which provides no end of techno-gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against . \nlice are endemic , and so ripley\'s head is shaved ( another surreal touch ) . \nat first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive , but it doesn\'t stay that way . \none of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches , and soon a newly-gestated alien is running amuck . \nworse , it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated . \nwhat\'s weird is how little tension this generates , except near the end , when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable : loud music , shaky camerawork , etc . sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role , and she does well with it , but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack . \nthe supporting actors are also not given a lot to do : the doctor ( charles dance ) and another , rather religious inmate ( charles s . dutton , very good ) , hiave presence , but they\'re not asked to do anything with it . \nin light of the impending sequel , which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie , i will not talk about the ending -- except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie . \nit\'s strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn\'t have driven the rest of it . \n'"
1,"b'the idea at the center of the devil\'s advocate , which is , thus far , one of the three or four best films of 1997 , is that no matter what decision is made , evil will triumph -- god is a trickster , satan is a humanist -- "" the last humanist "" . \nhe appears in many guises , and seduces many men and women -- in his own words , "" vanity -- by far my favorite sin "" . \nal pacino plays this role with relish , and gets to chew some delectable lines ( "" lemme givya a piece o\' inside wisdom on god . . .

1,"b'there\'s some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably shouldn\'t and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did . \n "" lucky numbers "" is a perfect example of this because it\'s such a blatant rip-off of "" fargo "" and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me . \ni know i\'m in the minority here but let me explain . \nthe film takes place in harrisburg , pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter . \njohn travolta plays the local big-shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards . \nruss is married to crystal ( lisa kudrow ) , a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema . \nshe\'s a selfish , nasty bitch full of lust and desire but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl - not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market . \ncrystal\'s cheating on russ with their collective boss dick ( ed o\'neil ) , the tv station manager . \nshe doesn\'t seem to genuinely like either of them , but it\'s all she can do in this one-horse town . \nmuch like "" fargo , "" this movie tells the story of a man who\'s going broke and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick . \nhe enlists the help of his english friend gig ( tim roth ) , the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery . \nalong the way a subplot involving a two-bit thug named , accurately , "" dale the thug "" ( michael rappaport ) gets mixed up in the process . \nthere\'s also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down . \ni\'m not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you\'re not expecting . \nthis is a farce , which is basically a straightforward , adult-oriented comedy but doesn\'t go as far as a classic black comedy should . \nwhere as "" fargo "" was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny , "" lucky numbers "" is just funny because you can\'t take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously . \nit\'s all a big cartoon basically , but it\'s funny and i can respect that . \ntravolta is great in his role and even though he\'s not a really likable character , he\'s trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he\'s a creep . \nhe\'s like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill . \ncrystal is just the opposite , she\'s constantly arguing and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself . \nkudrow is perfect in this role since she\'s spent 8 years on tv as the dim-witted phoebe on "" friends . "" \nhere is character is basically a very evil incarnation of phoebe . \ni have to admit i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money . \nlike "" jackie brown , "" ( an elmore leonard adaption ) , the story is about a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has been won illegally . \nthe screenplay does a fine job in balancing the characters and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus . \nmore and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic , cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do . \nthe ending itself is great . \nit\'s surprising and funny and makes you feel good . \nyou realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies\' worth of stories into two hours\' time and didn\'t fall apart ( although many other critics might beg to differ ) . \ni liked it , and i could see it again - isn\'t that what makes a movie good ? \n'"
0,"b""i suppose it's unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk , which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it's 1991 release . \nmichael lehmann's action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time' , or close thereof . \nthe movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk , who's just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation ( `let me put it this way , ' he explains , `i never saw et' ) . \ngreeting him is his old friend and partner in crime ( played by danny aiello ) , who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes . \nthese are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags , cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences . \nit appears as if director lehmann didn't know when to stop all the absurd silliness , and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line . \nif at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn't get goofier , you'll soon be eating your words . \nbut , i'm inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it's box office numbers suggest . \nit's fast-paced and entertaining , if you've got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor . \nfor the first portion of this review , i'm going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk . \nwish me luck . \nfirst and foremost : bruce willis is a good sport . \nwhile i'm not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script , willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big , fat , ugly joke . \nhe constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place , which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions . \nanother plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character . \nthey meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican , and their relationship escalates in interest from there . \nit's unfortunate that mcdowell's one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot-twist , and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis . \nbut now i'm rambling on again about the negative things , aren't i ? \nenough of the charade - for the most part , hudson hawk is an excruciating experience . \nit's stupid , pointless and repetitive . \ni can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater , because this film really doesn't have the potential to please anyone . \naction fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy , and even the action sequences are skittery , rushed and poorly edited . \nand those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache-inducing hi-jinks . \ndon't get me wrong , this film is not devoid of laughs . \nit's too bad most of them are unintentional , or just plain forced . \nthe impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed . \nit's understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber , but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i'm not entirely sure . \ncoburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play , and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie . \nespecially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown , and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film . \nthings get more bizarre when we're introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars , including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless , card-flipping kit-kat . \nif that's not enough for you , there's richard e . grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover . \ntheir crotch-biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here . \nwait , maybe the only big laughs . . . \ni'm not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk . \ni can't even begin to start about the film's absurd plot ; but let's not get into that . \ni suppose there's some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise , if they were that desperate . \nbut hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it's going from minute one , and from there it's 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck . \n"""
1,"b""in may of 1977 , just 2 years after steven spielberg's success with jaws and 3 years after francis coppolas' the godfather , a risky , ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success . \nlittle did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film . \nin january of this year , lucas re-released star wars on its 20th anniversary . \nin this new , remastered version , the added effects , which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computer-generated jabba the hutt , don't do much but call attention to themselves . \nother than these , the film is exactly the same . \nwhy pay to see it in the theaters , you might ask ? \nsimply because when this movie was released , most of us were a few years short of being born . \nwe should all get up and go to the movies for the experience , especially if you haven't seen it . \nthe plot is basic but in the same way , complex . \nit has many themes , but the one rotates around luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) and his quest to become a jedi knight . \nhis mission begins when a droid named r2-d2 plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , which tells him to contact the mysterious obi-wan kanoby ( alec guiness ) . \nhe and kanoby then , joined by two inter-galactic renegades , hans solo ( harrison ford ) and chewbacca , and skywalker's two droids d2 and c3po ( the voice of anthony edwards ) , wage war upon the corrupt empire , commanded by an evil general ( peter cushing ) and the traitorous darth vader ( the voice of james earl jones ) . \nskywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger : the force . \nthe film is obviously quite star-studded . \nbut how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones' voice would appear so many more times in the future ? \nit just happened to work out for him . \nthe magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker's triumph is symbolized by the audience's sense of becoming something larger than life itself-a universe of fans , young and old , recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever . \n , \n"""
1,"b'perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects . \nthere is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise . \nwhereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology . \nthe latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers\' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie\'s story . \nunlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event . \nit runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film\'s length . \ncontrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound . \nin this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp . \nwith its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented . \nthe script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach . \nbut , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent . \nthe viewers don\'t care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner . \nand right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast-paced , albeit frequently revisited story . \nas the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind . \nbillions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- "" farms "" our life energy . \nonly a select group of individuals knows of the "" real "" world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . \nmorpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth . \nthe cast plays out this story in stylish fashion . \nthe set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy . \nthe costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles . \nfor instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of "" agents "" created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather . \nthe casting cannot be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves isn\'t required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool . \nsupports in carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual . \none of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year\'s science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would\'ve worked from a different approach . \nthe alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise . \nthe better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun . \n'"
1,"b""the booming introduction music finishes , and the camera sweeps over red mountains . \nwe see two figures looking over a barren , and very red landscape . \nthey kiss , then walk on . \none of the characters ( schwarzenegger ) slips , and falls . \nthe glass on his mask cracks . \nhis face scruches up , and his eye's begin to pop . . . . . \nthen doug quaid , played by schwarzenegger , wakes up . \nit's all been a dream . \nhe wakes up next to his beautiful wife , played by stone , and the film begins . . . \ntotal recall is a typical sci-fi film wrapped around an intresting ( if far fetched ) plot . \nquaid , who has never been to mars , keeps on having dreams of the planet , which has now been colanised . \none day , while riding on a train , he's see's a ad for a company called 'rekall' , which implants memories of a holiday , instead of you actually going there yourself . \nquaid chooses the 'secret agent on mars' memory , and then the s * * * really hits the fan . \nthe implant goes wrong , and quaid really thinks he is an agent on mars for about two minutes , until he goes back to normal and can't remember a thing . \nhowever , everyone he knows ( his workmates , his wife ) turn against him , saying how 'blabbed about mars' and 'blew his cover on the mission' a strange man , called richter , played by ironside , wants to kill him . \nquaid , now hopelessly confused , follows the advice given to him , by a 'friend' . \nhe get's his ass to mars . \nmars is ruled by cohagen , played by cox , who charges people for air . \nagainst him are the rebels , who are mainly mutants . \nthe rebel's need quaid to defeat cohagen , because quaid knows ( but can't remember yet ) about a reactor that produces air . \neventually , quaid kills cohagen , turns on the reactor , saves the planet , and goes away with a beautiful girl , just like the guy at rekall promised him . \nthroughout this plot , there is huge explosions , thousands of deaths ( and i mean a lot of death ) swearing , sex , and everything else that make's a good verhoeven ( director of basic instinct and starship troopers ) movie . \nnaturally , there's some pretty imaginative deaths , with arms getting ripped off , someone getting drilled , and heads exploding . \nas you can tell , it's violent stuff . \nbut it's done so stylishly , and of course arnie tones it down with a one liner , that's it excusable . \nthe acting is variable . \narnie , of course , is useless , but he goes has some good lines , and in the first twenty minutes , he even act's like a normal bloke , not like some action hero . \nstone , of course , is useless , making a pretty poor wife , and a pretty poor action hero . \nbut , she does sex scenes alright . \nticoton ( most recently seen in con air ) , again , is ok , doing some good action , but getting her emotions all wrong . \none minute she hates quaid , the next she loves him , and she never gets this tranisition right . \nso , the good guys are awful . \nbut , the bad guy's are excellent . \ncox is basically reprising robocop , but he's still great in this , and he delivers the best line in the whole film near the end . \nironside is superbly evil , with an utterly emotionless face . \nthe supporting cast are fine , and not even the comedy sidekick ( this time in the form of a taxi driver ) is annoying . \none disappointing aspect , though , are the special effects . \nilm and dreamquest do some good work ( such as a subway station scene ) but the model work is not so good . \nsome of the model heads look appaling fake , and quatto is a major disappointment . \nanother irritating thing is the product placement . \nthere are a lot of plugs ( and a good mars today gag ) however , the sets look great , and the special effects at the end of the film aren't too bad either . \nthere's also a good soundtrack running through , by jerry goldsmith ( the omen , poltergeist , star trek : the motion picture ) \noverall , then , total recall is a hugely violent , yet hugely enjoyable , action fest , with a reasonable plot thrown in there too , some great bad guys , and some imaganitive death . \nfor a schwarzenegger movie , this is not bad at all . \nin fact , it's very good . \n"""
0,"b""note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nat the end of the day , those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros . made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere . \nthis highly-anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening , where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival studios' heavy hitters ; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's lack of confidence with the picture . \nand with good reason . \nthis is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit . \nremarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over substance , joel schumacher's much-loathed batman & robin . \n ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes . ) \numa thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage . \nunfortunately , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship . \nat this rate , usually-splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days . \nthe duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot . \nwhen not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs . peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot-on english accent . \nif nothing else , it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt . \nthe story , such as it is , involves the ever-bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate-controlling contraption . \n ( they also sip a lot of tea . ) \noverlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post-production tinkering ; it's clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds . \nthe avengers was never about gripping drama , and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac , it's all decidedly uncompelling . \nmr . connery , who's onscreen barely long enough to register an impression , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation , simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest . \nat least it all looks good . \nthis is a genuinely handsome production , with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt . \nin particular , the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention , adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain . \nthere are a handful of striking visual moments in the film , including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water , but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates . \nby the time the film's climax had arrived , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre . \nnot coincidentally , the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie's remarkable trailer , a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year . \nit's everything that the avengers is not -- saucy , clever , engaging , and entertaining . \na crushing disappointment , the film is one of the worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad , too polished to overlook its deficiencies . \nthere may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers , but i sure hope not . \n"""

"" what\'sgoingonaroundhere "" . \nthe marvelous sound of "" the stranger "" ( sam elliot ) \'s voice-over introduces the film . \nat least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up . \nthe dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the "" laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world "" , although he\'s not so much slothful as he is relaxed . \nspending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn\'t have much of a life , but he\'s having a good time . \nwhen asked what he does for fun , he responds "" bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback "" . \nlebowski\'s passion is bowling . \nwhen he\'s not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him . \narriving home one night , he\'s beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them . \neven worse , they urinate on his rug . \nthe problem is that the dude doesn\'t have a wife . \nhis assailants realize that their

day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake\'s mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug . \nthe carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it\'s virtually the only object there . \nwhen he\'s denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor . \non his way out , he runs into lebowski\'s trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who

clues . \nthat\'s the story , but to tell the truth it doesn\'t much matter . \nthere could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining . \nthe narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into . \nthe dude\'s bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you\'d see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they\'re not quite what they seem . \nwalter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties . \neverything that happens reminds him of a situation in

0,"b""retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year . \nearlier this may , leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top-rated miniseries that debuted on cbs . \nand now , director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies . \nstarring milla jovovich , who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch , `the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical re-enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend . \nbesson ( who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `the fifth element' ) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife jovovich , because in `the messenger' , the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience . \nat first , when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role , i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber . \nafter seeing the rousing trailer , my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - milla jovovich looked superb . \nwith the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , `the messenger' looked like a timeless epic in the making . \na timeless epic it is not . \nbesson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style , and the story behind `the messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands . \non the shoulders of besson's choppy and unexciting direction , the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery . \nthere is no human exploration into the character of joan ( or jeanne ) . \njovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective . \njovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard . \nshe is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast . \njovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power , but mainly , she looks lost . \nquite frankly , i don't know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through `the messenger' without a major fumble . \nthe script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy , as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii ( john malkovich ) and informs him of her heavenly intentions . \nfaye dunaway plays charles' overbearing mother-in-law , and dustin hoffman appears over two-hours into the story as a character dubbed ? the conscience' . \nall three actors juggle limited screen time , although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful . \nthe battle scenes are extremely bloody , but with the presence of such jittery camera work , they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like `braveheart' . \nthere's a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on , when jeanne ( as a young girl ) watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier . \neven his fellow troopers are petrified . \n`the messenger' is also strictly a 90's update on the classic story . \nalmost too 90's , it seems . \nthere's gratuitous use of the f-word and a barrage of slang terms like `she's nuts ! ' \nsprinkled throughout the screenplay . \ni was half-expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib , but it never happened . \nthere's also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor , but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly . \nit seems terribly misplaced , but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `the messenger' , almost everything does . \nthe musical score by erric serra is spectacular , and the set and production designs are continuously impressive . \nif it was visual excellence that besson was striving for , then he achieves his goal . \nbut the only time the dramatics come alive in `the messenger' is during the closing trial , in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake . \nduring these moments , the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience , albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning . \nit's just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation , in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects . \n`the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf . \nanyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film . \ndespite my original hopefulness , milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy . \n"""

"" \nsometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood . \nsince then , epics have appeared infrequently ( "" the last emperor , "" "" braveheart "" ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970\'s ( "" roots , "" "" shogun "" ) . \nyet , the phrase "" we who are about to die salute you "" has been absent until now . \n "" gladiator "" begins in germania in a . d . 180 . \nroman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting . \nhowever , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again . \nwhen commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered . \nmaximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son . \na caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa . \n ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus\' place is never explained . ) \nan african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus\' wounds . \nproximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena . \nof course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads . \nwhen commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete . \nour hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus\' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen ) . \nthe similarities to "" braveheart "" are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess . \nalso , like mel gibson\'s epic , "" gladiator "" has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero\'s anger . \nit\'s a simple tale of good versus evil . \nmaximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family . \ncommodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience . \nthe opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male , and that seems appropriate . \n "" gladiator "" is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a "" chick flick "" be a "" dick flick "" ? ) . \nthere\'s much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences . \n ( those easily offended by gore should stay away . ) \nlucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife . \njoaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance . \nin the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father\'s love or pride . \nthroughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who\'s scripted as a caricature of evil . \ni\'ve been a russell crowe fan since "" romper stomper . "" \nthis role doesn\'t offer him the complexities of his parts in "" l . \na . confidential "" and "" the insider "" -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre . \nthe late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role . \ni hope it will be rewarded with an oscar . \nmy only major quibble with "" gladiator "" is its stylized look . \nseveral scenes are tinted . \nwe\'ve seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in "" payback "" and "" the matrix . "" \ni don\'t get the appeal of the style , which makes feature films look like tv ads . \nin "" payback "" it was merely annoying , but in "" gladiator "" it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d\'etre of the roman epic . \n ( perhaps it\'s meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer-generated shots . ) \nalso , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously . \n ( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books , leaving a half-blurred trail of images of himself behind . ) \nwith a more realistic look , "" gladiator "" could be even more satisfying than "" braveheart "" because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion . \nbottom line : a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices . \n'"
1,"b'it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship , a green ovular pin , and the birth of oscar wilde , but if one really strains , they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off . \nwilde\'s philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature , and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned , loosing his family and his career . \nthe glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise . \nthe main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) , they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else . \nand that\'s why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began . \nit\'s been said that todd haynes\' "" velvet goldmine , "" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement , not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it , steals a lot from "" citizen kane , "" and that\'s true . \nin the film , a british journalist in the 80s , arthur stuart ( christian bale ) , is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade , a fictitious rock star , who faked his own death on stage , bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement . \nstructure-wise , this totally steals from "" kane , "" not only from the set-up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours . \nthis is no "" kane , "" and it really doesn\'t aspire to be : it doesn\'t attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like "" kane "" did , and it doesn\'t really uncover anything poignant about humanity . \ninstead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants . \nthe 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy , equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging . \nbut the 70s scenes are engaging , though , not to mention addictively campy . \nthey radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era , and a feel that\'s so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then-footage , they become not only a symbol of decadence , but of times when everything seemed so simple . \ninstead of creating the world the way it was , haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you\'ve experienced it , everything else seems so mundane . \nthere\'s no outside world to speak of , secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack . \nhaynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero , curt wild , and their relationship that created , molded , and then brought down the movement , reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors . \nblade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop , respectively , complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one-time partners in music , but also partners in bed . \nthrough discussions with slade\'s ex-manager cecil ( michael feast ) , ex-wife mandy ( toni collette , reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade ) , and finally ex-partner wild , journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era , like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity , including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record , he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket ) , and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene , finally resulting in leading a boring job in america . \nhaynes demonstrates that he\'s quite the visual auteur , molding scenes that are like long heald breaths , such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade/wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover , "" baby\'s on fire , "" with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film\'s most wow-inspiring sequence , the first concert scene of wild with his band , the ratttz , where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy-esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent , and another ( slade ) discovers his idle . \neven the brief music videos , spoofs of bowie\'s , have a rare visual flair that\'s pure camp , and which would cause ken russell to drool . \nthe best sequence , though , may be the beginning , following the prelude , a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post-movement era . \nin it , stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death , where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination , which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet . \nwith brian eno\'s famous "" needle in the camel\'s eye "" playing in the background , the scene has a detached exhileration - the song doesn\'t seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are . \nit has a distance that\'s hard to put a finger on , and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending , and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show , docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair , depressingly staring into the mirror , it comes off as a none-too-obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film . \nthis movie\'s not so much about plot , but more about the way it is presented , making this one of those films which is classified as being "" style over substance , "" a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack . \nhowever , for the most part , the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world , by using his sets , costumes , cinematography , and especially the music to play as characters in his film . \nthe music is especially notable . \nthe soundtrack , which is wall to wall , consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno , t-rex , and roxy music , as well as covers by slade\'s band ( with vocals by thom yorke , and occasionally rhys meyers himself ) , and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie-like . \nthe cast is rather impressive , but no one really walks away with the film , and no performances are extremely good . \nalthough eddie izzard , as slade\'s manager ( who challenges slade\'s first manager to an arm-wrestling match to see who gets control of his career ) and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly , and collette and mcgregor have their moments , rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub-par , neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles . \nsome of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes . \nrhys meyers\' brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era , dying when he turned into a retro-garbo , resorting to a life of salinger-ism , and found in the mid-70s to be lying around , sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl . \nin fact , no one in this film is really seen as a person , rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era . \nbale\'s character is an especially tough sell : bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood , he\'s not an extremely personal character , and his cliched experiences ( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a "" poof "" ) never help us communicate with him . \nnevertheless , rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them , and others , bitter , part of which helps the film work , since this is a major piece of eye candy . \nat the prime of the movie , they at least look the role of fashionable leaders - slade with his perpetually-changing , androgonys persona , and wild with his topless and unpredictable image , which clash and fuse into an unstable union . \ntheir story - of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who-cares attitude crossed with camp - is engaging , without the personal background . \nthe story of stuart , though , is a tougher sell because he\'s the everyman , and when you can\'t totally identify with the everyman , your story\'s in slight trouble . \nas a cultural rock piece , "" velvet goldmine "" is rather good , but it is merely good . \nit never totally takes off , although it has moments where it absolutely flies , but then comes back down . \nit\'s really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments , surrounded by material that could really be much better . \nthe beginning is captivating but slow , the middle is fantastic , and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that , it drags ( the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion , it could probably stop at any point ) . \nand did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths ? \nit almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past , which is commendable but not totally so . \nstill , it does what the oliver stone pic "" the doors "" didn\'t do right , becoming very insightful to what happened , using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems half-assed ( i suppose the message is : "" live life , but after you\'ve lived it , what else is the point when you\'ll be forced to live with regretful memories ? "" ) . \nthe really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks , it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era , but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down . \n'"

1,"b'steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities , because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits , like jurassic park , and "" oscar "" -awarded critical triumphs like schindler\'s list . \nhowever , in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories . \none of them is close encounters of the third kind , extremely popular and influential science-fiction spectacle . \nunfortunately , it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars . \nalthough both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects , brilliant score by john williams ) their future was different ; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon , and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow . \nwhen spielberg began work on that project , he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit , jaws . \ntogether with other young directors of his "" new hollywood "" generation , like kauffman , carpenter , hill and millius , he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s , when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment . \nironically , it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of "" blockubuster "" philosophy . \nbut in the mid 1970s , many things were different ; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie . \nalthough very personal , spielberg\'s screenplay was partly based on the book "" ufo experience "" by dr . j . allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2 . \nspielberg was not only inspired by the mythology , but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost , unmatched until the contemporary era of x-files and the roswell anniversary . \nthat was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo-related incidents as the element of the plot . \nthe story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u . s . navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19 . \nsuch events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss ) , power company worker from muncie , indiana , who later becomes obsessed with his experience . \nbecause of his obsession he loses his job , family and sanity , but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon ) , single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction . \nin the meantime , the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u . s . government , in co-operation with the french , led by lacombe ( francois truffaut ) begin with the preparation for ultra-secret project . \nwhen the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary , he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area . \nthere he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions . \ntwo of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there . \nspielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects . \nthe slow , gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents - "" close encounters "" - is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale . \nbut , instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws , we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder . \nthroughout the movie the viewer knows that something big , magnificent and wonderful is about to happen , and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end . \nthe last sequence , with its , even in this age , impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull , would leave many mouths open . \none of the great virtues of this film is its optimism . \naliens , who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in science-fiction cinema , are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful . \nit is very ironic , when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story - howard hawks\' thing and byron haskin\'s war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind . \nspielberg\'s humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era ; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post-watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public . \nbut , even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chain-smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to x-files and its more cynical and disturbing visions . \nthere lies the main , and probably the only flaw of this great picture - lack of conflict , and consequently , lack of drama . \nthe movie has few excitements or even action scenes ( especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock\'s north by northwest ) but generally , almost everyone - neary , jillian , government , aliens - are the good guys . \ndespite such shortcomings , the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles . \nrichard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary , yet nice guy , who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale . \nmelinda dillon was , on the other hand , nominated for "" oscar "" as a struggling mother , yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary\'s long-suffering wife ronnie . \napart from visual wonders of this film , spielberg\'s semi-official composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music , this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot , and as the basis for his score . \nthe aliens , who are the main subject of this film , were visually very convincing . \ntoo convincing , one of my acquaintances in the ufo-researching circles said . \naccording to him , the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey-skinned little people with big eyes was so accurate , that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos . \nso , they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien , this time designed to be anything but the real life . \nthe result was e . t . , for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times , yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts . \nanyway , whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos , close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie , and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema . \n'"
1,"b'in 1995 , brian singer and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up a simple concept : the audience isn\'t stupid . \nfrom that , they went on and created the most plot-driven , intricately pieced movie in the last 25 years . \nthe result : the usual suspects , one hell of a movie that redefines the word plot twist . \nthe story is convoluted , and is really confusing to read , although easy to follow on screen . \nspecial investigator kujan ( chazz palminteri ) grills "" verbal "" kint ( kevin spacey ) , a crippled con-man who is the lone survivor of an la boat explosion that claimed more than 20 victims . \nkujan wants to confirm that his nemesis , the rogue cop keaton ( gabriel byrne ) , is actually dead . \nkint relates the majority of the film in flashback , beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet in a police-station lineup in new york city . \nalong with dour keaton , kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus ( stephen baldwin ) , mordantly sarcastic hockney ( kevin pollak ) , and fenster ( benicio del toro ) , whose speech is virtually incomprehensible . \ntogether they plot to steal a small fortune in gems from "" new york\'s finest taxi service "" --crooked cops who provide escort service for visiting drug kingpins . \nwhat follows is a shell-game of violence and betrayal , all hinging on the identity of a mysterious villain called keyser soze . \nthe film is brilliantly compact : its the shortest 90 minutes you\'ll ever spend in a movie theater . \nthe cast is exceptional . \npalminteri shines , he is brutally honest , a true cop , one who is going after the whole story because its there . \nbyrne is terrific , his brooding character , his seriousness is needed to supplement the hysteria of benicio del toro , who is a riot as fenster . \ndel toro is brilliant , his lines are a jumbled mess , you can\'t understand a word the man says , but it sure is damn funny . \nbaldwin is also very good , he is careful , methodical , and cold , a chilling character with a nasty streak of hot-blooded sarcasm . \npollak is also terrific as usual , a very good character actor . \nhowever , this will be forever known as the film that launched kevin spacey . \nspacey is simply breathtaking , he is a force on screen , giving a magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze . \nspacey\'s performance will be remembered for years , for it is the best of his career , it may be the best supporting actor performance in the last 50 years . \nverbal kint is a clever storyteller , weak , oppressed , and gleefully evil to the bone , yet pitiful , one who draws sympathy . \nthe film is a good one , a decent film until the last 10 minutes . \nwhat this film boils down to is the greatest ending in cinematic history , for me at least . \nthe revelation of keyser soze , the closing gunfights , it is something wondrous . \nyou have to see this movie about 10 times to believe what they do . \nkudos to mcquarrie and singer for giving the audience a delightful , fast-paced , furiously plot-driven movie with quirky characters , phenomenal acting , and some hilarious moments stuck in the middle . \nmcquarrie refuses to believe the audience is dumb . \nwithout furnishing too many details , he concocts his story and lets it run , hoping the audience gets it at the end . \nwe do . \nthis might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever created . \nkudos also to singer and john ottman , who created the score . \nthey both create what is a true film-noir setting , carefully setting up this intricate puzzle until the final , jarring ending . \nthere are flaws : more questions raised than answers , lack of character development , and no strong female characters ( save one ) . \nhowever , the plot , and that stunning ending , make up for all the flaws and more . \nif you haven\'t seen the movie , rent it . \nwatch it . \nthen rewind the tape , and watch it again . \ntrust me , you\'ll be amazed . \n'"
0,"b'a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title , a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided , for this confused , confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle , producer andrew macdonald , and screenwriter john hodge . \nat the core of this strange film is a fairly basic--and , yes , ordinary--premise . \nafter robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgregor ) , an aspiring writer of trashy novels , is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation , he kidnaps naville\'s ( ian holm ) spoiled daughter celine ( cameron diaz ) and holds her for ransom . \nthe joke here is that celine is a willing victim--her father threatened to cut her off financially , so she wants revenge--and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping . . . \nand , ultimately ( didn\'t we see this one coming ? ) , \nlove . \nso far , so mediocre . \nbut mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is , thanks in no small part to the hodge\'s contextual frame for the romance . \nit turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven\'s police , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels , o\'reilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celine and robert--or lose their angel status . \nthis conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture . \nbut it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand . \nnot that there is much of a romance to begin with . \ntry as diaz and mcgregor may , celine and robert are too one-note to become very endearing characters . \nceline is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard . \nas such , it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two--then again , they never seem to really connect with each other . \nwhen celine and robert start to overtly act on their "" feelings , "" it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural . \nbut i am not exactly sure if boyle and company\'s point was romance ; honestly , i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish . \nboyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz , but it remains just that--energy , not energy in service of a story or even acting . \nthe cast seems lost , especially hunter , whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling . \nand then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film : some violent confrontations involving the angels , who are not exactly angelic--in fact , they end up staging their own ransom scheme ; some mystical hokum in the climax ; and a cutesy claymation epilogue . \nwatching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell , stockpiling quirks in the name of cool . \ninstead , the film just gives quirky a bad name . \nmy best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes , misspelling intended ) whimsy , which comes through in only one scene : an extended musical number where celine and robert sing "" beyond the sea "" at a karaoke bar . \nafter a verse or two , the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos , and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter . \nthe scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard , just relying on the innate charm of the leads , allowing them to build a romantic rapport . \nalas , not nearly enough is built , for this moment comes to an abrupt end . \ni applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses , but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill . \na life less ordinary certainly delivers something "" different , "" but by the time the film was over , i was clamoring for a life more ordinary . \n "" i can accept failure . \neveryone fails at something . \nbut i can\'t accept not trying . \nit doesn\'t matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart .

1,"b'i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool . \ni spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement . \nthis was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm . \nthen marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups . \nit certainly didn\'t look that way from the outset , which introduces groom-to-be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his "" last night of freedom . "" \nben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney ) , but the doom-and-gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this \'till death do you part business . \nthen , on an ill-fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah , ben meets sarah lewis ( sandra bullock ) , a free-spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her . \nas transportation troubles thwart them at every turn , ben and sarah begin a three-day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger , ben seeing in sarah the chances he\'s never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she\'s never had . \nforces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue . \nben is an ideal role for affleck\'s easy-going charm , and he plays the straight-laced straight man without forced exasperation . \nsandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping . \nthe two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start , yet the script\'s apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely . \nlively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification . \nthe kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution . \nforces of nature isn\'t about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it\'s about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it\'s not what he thought it was . \nlawrence\'s script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense . \nearlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine . \nthough one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you\'ll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom . \nthat is , provided you\'re not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes . \nfor a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots , why-not low or high angles , sweeping pans . \noccasionally the hyper-real approach works , with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often , hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is , covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can\'t find what\'s underneath . \na script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director , but even hughes\' excesses can\'t spoil this unique concoction . \nforces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant , something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents . \n'"
1,"b'the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes , and the greedy trade federation has used it\'s armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo . \nwe soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo\'s ruler , the young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) to sign a treaty giving the federation control . \nhowever , the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade . \nno sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi , and the first battle begins . \nit seems that for me and thousands of people like me , the love for george lucas\'s trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time . \nwe\'re the fans , not the freaks . \nwe won\'t go dressing up like darth vader ( although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool ) , and we won\'t incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations ( not all the time , anyway ) , but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest , we\'re throwing down . \nall right , stop looking at me like that . \nwe have been faithfully and patiently waiting . \nwaiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll . \nyou see , the trilogy is not just a set of movies , but a religion of sorts to we , the faithful disciples , and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah . \nunfortunately , it is not our savior . \nfor weeks beforehand , i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good . \nanything less and it\'ll be the biggest disappointment of the century . \ni didn\'t want the doomsaying prophecy to come true , really i didn\'t , but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking . \ncharacter development is virtually nonexistent . \nwith the possible exception of qui-gon , most of the film\'s characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions . \nnone seem very affected by their experiences , and few even show any passion at all . \ncontrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks , a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo , in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala . \njar jar\'s life is saved by qui-gon early in the film , and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so ) . \nhis speech mannerisms are so "" cute-ified "" that i couldn\'t understand a third of what he was saying , and the slapstick he performed was just distracting . \nhis head gets caught in an electronic field , his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast , he describes being in trouble as "" deep doo doo , "" and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport . \ntherein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors . \nin star wars , we had obi-wan telling us mos eisley was a "" wretched hive of scum and villainy . "" \nin the phantom menace , we get doo doo . \nthe films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story "" a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away . . . . "" \nthis film , on the other hand , constantly reminds me that it\'s only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience . \nperhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition ( it\'s kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses ) , and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500-like play by play . \ni liked the pod race ; it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension , but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters ? \nthe race would have been even more exciting without the distraction . \nthis aspect , coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me . \ni suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer , but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all ? \ndidn\'t millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again ? \ndidn\'t the action figures still sell like hotcakes ? \nof course they did , and it\'s only poor judgment that allows the most-eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults . \none aspect that will appeal broadly , however , is the use of special effects . \nthe people at lucas\'s industrial light and magic , the world\'s premiere effects house , outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer-generated images and real-life footage . \nsome of the scenes have to be seen to be believed , especially the shots of a land battle between the federation\'s robot army and jar jar\'s countrymen . \nthe space battles are also impressive , although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer . \nthis , however , is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today . \njohn williams is back , of course , providing a score for the film as only he can . \nhis music is pervasive throughout , as rousing and as dramatic as ever , always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately . \nsince this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine-episode story ( star wars , the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four , five and six , respectively ) , the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already , in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar . \nas a result , attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin . \nit would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi-wan , for example , but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover , it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films . \none of the new characters is darth maul , hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film\'s release . \nin spite of the hype , darth maul is a character which almost didn\'t have to be in the film , his role is so insignificant . \nhe has maybe three spoken lines ( believe it or not , a second actor voices the character ) and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean . \nwith that working against him , he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment . \nlucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe , something which has been prominent throughout . \nhowever , he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible , offering an easy out for story-writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real-life connection . \noddly , while trying to capitalize on spirituality , lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force-loving parasites in your body\'s cells . \nthis only serves to de-mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection . \ndon\'t let me mislead you too far . \nthe phantom menace , by most standards , is a good film . \nit contains a lot of visual treats , sets the stage for an epic story , gives us a bit of excitement here and there , and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends . \nit\'s just that when held up to it\'s predecessors ( and to not do so would be unrealistic ) , this film simply pales . \n'"

1,"b'the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible . \npeople may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized , methodical hatred . \nfive concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days , the first documentary from steven spielberg\'s survivors of the shoah visual history foundation . \nthe five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry . \nas the introduction explains , even as germany started to lose the war , the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe . \nin 1944 , hungary had the last big population of jews within germany\'s reach , and they became the last target of hitler\'s "" final solution .

1,"b""the premise of the new teen-targeted horror film `final destination' causes a recollection of a memorable `simpsons' halloween episode . \nafter attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster , lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time-machine . \nafter a trek into the cretaceous period , homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world . \nagain and again , homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it . \nthe characters of `final destination' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence - their `design' . \nsomeone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake . \nthat someone is death . \nyou see , alex browning ( devon sawa ) and six others have cheated the grim reaper . . . . \nbut the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve . \nfor a high school excursion , alex's french class is traveling to paris by airline transport . \nalex , tense and neurotic , has a shocking premonition after boarding : he sees the plane , and every passenger on it , spontaneously explode in mid-air . \nin a panic of sheer lunacy , alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft . \nafter a handful of others ( including one teacher ) follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane , the unwitting ? survivors' watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky . \nthe loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize . \nbut death won't be cheated so easily , and one by one , the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances . \nthe grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi . \nbefore i delve into the meat of the review , i'd just like to confer . . . . \nis that one helluva premise , or what ? \n`final destination' , creepy beyond rational comprehension , probably reads more like an unsettling `x-files' episode than `the simpsons' - therefore , the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong . \non familiar turf , the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong , and the opening 20 minutes of `final destination' reflects that . \nunlike most thrillers , the set-up is crisp and cool . \nyou just deeply , sincerely hope that the momentum won't unspool , leaving us with a second-string effort with nothing but cheap , derivative shocks . \nyoung viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration , what with `i know what you did last summer' and sequel , `idle hands' and -- a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- `urban legend' . \nafter the set-up , when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair , i started to really have fun with `final destination' . \nlow and behold , a teen thriller that is actually unsettling , actually suspenseful and -- yes -- actually intelligent . \nsome splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside , this film is among the most refreshing and all-out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting-edge `scream' in 1996 . \n`final destination' stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood-spattered slasher crap we've endured throughout the past few years . \nnot that the characters are that good . \nsawa is game as alex , a connect-the-dots personality that we never fully comprehend . \nin addition , the survivors are endearing geek tod ( chad e . donella ) , jocky control-freak carter ( kerr smith of `dawson's creek' ) , carter's ditzy girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the none-too-subtly named billy hitchcock ( seann william scott , supplier of lukewarm comic relief ) and a lone teacher - the emotionally delicate ms . lewton ( kristin cloke ) . \naside from alex , the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter ( `varsity blues' ) , playing an abstract character named clear rivers ( what were her parents thinking ? ! ? ) . \nthe personality of clear is written with such a vague , nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flash-card saying `hello , i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character's plight !

1,"b'alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters . \ni saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn\'t like it . \nof course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault . \nin order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor . \njames cameron\'s aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series . \ni am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality . \nmany thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action . \nboth are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written . \nas for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion . \nperhaps watching alien 3 on video helped . \non the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn\'t see . \nit was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh . \ni had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities . \ndon\'t get me wrong--i\'m not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting . \nhowever , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters . \nas a result , alien 3\'s only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters . \nwe never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie . \nthere were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt . ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films . \nthe other character was dr . clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs . \nalien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off . \nthe prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry . \nwithout using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film . \nan impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card . \nwe see lt . ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments . . . \n ( title ) . . . \na shot of an alien egg . . . \n ( title ) . . . \nalien legs stretch up into the air . . . \n ( title ) . . . \nand so on and so on . \nduring these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed . \nit\'s quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time . \nbecause of this face-hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury-161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison . \nhowever , the face-hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo-tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod . \nunfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed . \nripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery . \nof course , you need a carrier for this face-hugger , and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates . \nripley is revived and asks to see the ship . \nafter seeing a mysterious acid-eaten section , ripley asks to see the dead bodies , and then have them cremated . \nthis cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films . \nfeaturing a monologue from dillon ( charles s . dutton ) , a prisoner who has found god , the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog\'s demise . \nit\'s one of the most memorable moments , as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog . \nand this is where alien 3 succeeds . \nfincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films , and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock ( in fact , he is the mixture of both ) . \nfincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films . \nalien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images . \nby doing so , fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise . \nmany people have criticized fincher\'s filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake , but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal . \nshowing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch , but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron , a great deal of symbolism is derived . \ni feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron . \nhowever , most people seem to want to witness ripley die ( which creates a paradox , as she is the character i didn\'t want to see die ) . \nwhy she is killed is one of the surprises of the film , and i don\'t plan on spoiling that in this review . \n>from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever . \nin alien , it was , of course , the moment the alien burst out of kane\'s stomach . \nin aliens , it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine . \nalien 3 has several , but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley . \nripley is pushed up against a wall , and the alien stands inches away from her . \nwhy it doesn\'t kill her is a shocker , which later leads to a surprise ending . \nfincher apparently loves to use close-ups of actors\' faces ( michael douglas and the clown face-off in the game in the same style ) , and by shaving off the actors\' hair , the only thing we have to look at is their faces . \nmany critics didn\'t like all the actors being bald , but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot . \nmost of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story , but when you try to compare it to its predecessors , fincher\'s turn seems a bit gloomy and dark , though that\'s not always a bad thing . \nthe plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films , with some major twists . \nagain , we are setup with several different characters , and one by one , they are picked off . \nhowever , while the first two had tons of arsenal ( especially cameron\'s film ) , alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run-down prison . \nas a result , no weapons are to be found . \nthis creates a lot of tension , although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense . \nas an alien film , alien 3 is the worst of the series , but by itself , it is an extremely well-made motion picture , with a lot more merits than not . \nthe unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one-dimensional characters . \ni never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about . \ndespite this , ripley was the central figure , and that\'s what is important . \nwe care for her , even though she began to act just like one of the guys . \nagain , the technical side of this film is remarkable , and better than the two previous versions . \nwhile cameron\'s version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary , fincher uses brilliant camera angles , terrific lighting , and moody sets . \nthe cinematography , by alex thomson , is very well done , with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie . \nthe confusion of the ending draws the viewer in , as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around . \nthe yellows , reds , and oranges of the lights create a dark mood , and by themselves create a lot of suspense . \nshadows dance on the walls , and yet those shadows could easily be the alien . \nthe alien is different from its predecessors this time around , and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense . \nthe camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien , racing after the characters . \nthe sets are quite incredible , which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien . \nthe narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed . \nthe sets appear to be in the future , but not too far in the future . \none of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien ( nothing surprising there ) . \nsigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance , equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens . \nshe was snubbed at the oscars for this one , mainly because the film was a critical bomb . \nher reactions are far more realistic in this film , with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter . \nit\'s quite touching really . \ncharles s . dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates , and i was on the brink of actually caring for him . \ncharles dance turns in a nice low-key performance , and as a result , i cared for him immediately . \nlance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii , but he was more entertaining in aliens . \nthe rest of the cast is pretty stale , though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world . \nalien 3 is rated r for strong violence and language , and sex . \nalthough it has its flaws , alien 3 is highly entertaining with rich symbolism . \nthis film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie . \nwhile kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films , fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out . \nit\'s a film like fincher\'s which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity ( the final scene ) . \nin fact , it tells us that we , as a society , have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little "" fake . "" \nwhenever something looks fake on screen , we immediately point it out as a mistake . \nbut perhaps it isn\'t a mistake . \n'"
0,"b'actually , i\'m fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie . \n "" baywatch "" babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double-d\'s on the small screen . \nat least there you don\'t have to pay to see her cleavage . \nand for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless , hate to burst your bubble , but there are no full-fledged nude scenes in barb wire . \nyou wouldn\'t be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in . \ni can\'t go back in time and reverse my mistake , but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there . \nthey do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude , it\'s so quick you can\'t even tell for sure whether you\'re seeing her andersons or not . \na nipple hallucination sort of thing . \nbarb wire was adapted from a comic book , interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life , even wearing low-cut leather to do office work ( businesswoman bondage wear ) and having unreal body proportions . \nyes , like the mona lisa , pamela anderson is a man-made beauty , probably in more senses than one . \nshe is a definite beauty , though , and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience . \nyou\'d just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn\'t have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie , because it\'s obvious she wasn\'t pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills . \ni mean , she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler\'s convention . \nthe movie is set in the year 2017 , "" the worst year of my life , "" pam says . \n ( "" the worst movie of the year , "" i say . ) \namerica is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation ( silicone valley , i think ) . \nshe also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right , posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute . \nbut don\'t call her "" babe .

1,"b'there\'s something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days . \nstiller currently has three projects in circulation , and what other actor can lay claim to that ? \nhe\'s in "" there\'s something about mary , "" which i * still * haven\'t seen . \nand he\'s in the acerbic "" your friends & neighbors , "" playing a talkative , sexually-frustrated drama coach called jerri . \nnow there\'s "" permanent midnight , "" in which stiller plays another jerry , this one a heroin-addicted television writer , last name stahl . \nthere\'s also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures the minute they\'ve proved themselves commercially . \newan mcgregor springs to mind who , after successful turns in "" emma "" and "" brassed off , "" received greater respect and admiration for his mind-blowing realization as renton in danny boyle\'s transatlantic junk-fest , "" trainspotting . "" \nthe philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want \'em to be taken seriously , make \'em do drugs . \n "" permanent midnight "" is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid-eighties , had a $5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6 , 000-a-week heroin habit . \na habit , in stahl\'s own words , "" the size of utah .

1,"b'with many big-budget science fiction films , great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts , cheesy plot twists , and , terrible acting . \nthe fifth element , the abyss , and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting , writing , or both . \nat first glance , the matrix , larry & andy wachowski\'s sci-fi/kung-fu/shoot-em-up spectacular , looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high-concept bad movies , especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role . \nbut despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue , the matrix works . \nit\'s an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films ( most obviously the terminator films , star wars , and total recall ) , but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout . \nreeves plays neo , a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with "" trinity "" ( carrie-anne moss ) , a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks , a unseen , omniscient cult figure known as "" morpheus "" ( lawrence fishburne ) , and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell . \nneo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems . \nmoreover , he discovers that the grim , bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it . \nneo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah , with grave doubts that he is actually "" the one "" prophesized to come and save the world . \nreluctant or not , what follows is a mix of hong kong-style slow-motion shootouts , surreal dream sequences , high speed chases , and comic book kung-fu fights . \nthe film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality . \nhow exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind ? \nand if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in , would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion ? \nunfortunately , the matrix doesn\'t provide many answers to the questions it raises , but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions , shoot-outs , and flying roundhouse kicks . \nperhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving , who plays agent smith , the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix . \nweaving\'s stony appearance , deadpan voice , and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting , evil technological force that controls the matrix . \nlike robert patrick as the shapeshifting t-1000 terminator in terminator 2 : judgement day , weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because , despite his power and seeming invincibility , he looks ordinary , even scrawny . \nweaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence . \nthe film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography . \nit seems to be deliberately kitchy , with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors . \nin a few scenes , the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny . \njust seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring . \nhowever , with the comic-book style and tone of the film , you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience . \nthe matrix isn\'t a classic . \nits open-ended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers . \nit fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions . \nit also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero - the kind of shmaltzy feel-good goo that most of the film avoids . \nreportedly , the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel . \nunfortunately , audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future . \nthe matrix is an fun , enjoyable diversion , like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival . \njust don\'t be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry . \n'"

1,"b'i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set , unless i\'m watching a movie . \ni don\'t even have cable , so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching "" the x-files "" every sunday night . \nit\'s the only show that\'s worth an hour of my time each week ( though , since i don\'t watch reruns , i\'m glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether ) . \ni am an avid fan of the show , and have been for about three years now . \nand i love gillian anderson . \nthe x-files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off . \nthe film is like a two-hour episode , except that there are a lot more special effects , the plot is thicker , and the resolution is more satisfying . \nthis is a terrific film , both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it ( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment ) . \ni expected to like it more than any episode i\'ve seen , and my expectations were met . \nactually , the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices , but , thankfully , the makers managed to do it right . \nwhen the finale ended , the fbi branch known as the x-files had been destroyed , and our heroes , mulder ( david duchovny ) and scully ( gillian anderson ) were left stripped of five years of hard work . \nthe film picks up soon after ; and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building . \nbut wait , i\'m getting ahead of myself . \nthe film actually opens in the ice age , about 32 , 000 years prior , during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien . \nthe alien\'s blood infects them ( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer ) , and the story jumps into modern times , during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer . \nit turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy , and mulder and scully uncover the cover-up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi . \nsoon , they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens . \nas i\'ve written before , it\'s not easy to write plot summaries for films like this , because everything needs to be a surprise . \nfans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film . \ndirector rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen , making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television . \nthere are some truly suspenseful and well-created scenes here ( late in the film , when they\'re in the alien spacecraft , you\'ll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema ) . \nthe special effects are very good , and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic . \nwhat i find interesting is that the x-files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story . \nour heroes are given subtle introductions ( we\'re not expected to know them on the outset ) , and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn\'t required to understand the film . \nthere are , of course , little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans , but i\'ll keep those as surprises . \nit takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides , and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly . \nthe series is strong for a lot of reasons . \nit\'s original ( though it has many ties to "" the twilight zone "" and owes some homage to hitchcock ) , and impressively eerie for a television show . \nwhat really makes the series shine , however , are the actors . \nduchovny has so much presence , and is just a fun guy to watch . \nhe has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man . \nanderson is equally good , and paralyzingly beautiful ; she\'s also a strong actress . \nboth performers have acted in little more than their series , however , though i think they\'ll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon . \ni enthusiastically recommend the x-files , both for fans and non-fans . \n1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters , and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry . \nit\'s an intelligent film , and takes you places that you might not have been ( or , at least , might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar ) . \nthe x-files is impressive in concept , as well : fans of the series are likely to be highly critical , and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move . \nit\'s nice to see a risk pay off for a change . \nactually , it\'s nice to see a risk at all . \n'"

"" \nas it turns out , this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence , but to the rest of the movie as well . \nin this , the latest of the jackie chan movies to be released in america after first runs in hong kong , chan plays an international operative codenamed "" condor "" , and is tasked by the united nations with finding a stash of gold hidden at a secret base by the nazi\'s during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war . \nfor some reason , condor is given his mission at the u . s . embassy in spain . \ni think this may have been done so that in a chase scene , they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart . \nwatch for it in any chase scene set in a foreign country , most notably in europe . \nthe chase will take itself through a marketplace , and a fruit cart will be overturned . \nit\'s almost a guarantee . \nanyway . . . . \ncondor is given a key which is supposed to unlock a giant vault in which the gold is hidden ; the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it , which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly . \nto help him figure out where the gold is hidden and how to use the key correctly , condor is accompanied by a desert expert ( carol cheng ) and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold ( eva cobo ) . \nthere aren\'t supposed to be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain , but condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something . \nalthough these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission , they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts . \nin fact , most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just a way to set up a fight . \ni suppose this isn\'t so bad , since chan\'s action is really the best part of the movie , and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway . \nif you\'ve never seen a jackie chan movie , don\'t expect a great plot , but do expect to be entertained by his moves . \nthey are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human . \nknowing that he does his own stunts , and knowing that this is the real stuff ( no computer-masked bungee cords here ) makes the action sequences all the more exciting . \nyou\'ve got to hand it to a guy who\'s probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art . \nalso of note in this , as in any jackie chan movie , is the humor . \nas far as i know , none of his films take themselves too seriously , and even the dramatic parts have a certain tongue-in-cheek quality about them . \nwhat is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes . \nunlike a martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme , where the fights get you on the visceral level , fight scenes in chan\'s movies are simply entertaining . \nyou marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such a way to make you laugh . \nunfortunately , even chan\'s mastery can\'t save this film . \nthe plot and characters are so weak that they don\'t hold the movie together at all , and the acting is terrible . \ncarol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movie awards in the past , but since operation condor is a dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off . \nthis , combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until i heard those kicks start flying . \n'"

1,"b""those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo's novel les miserables . \ni don't know if a lot of people have , though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel . \ni haven't even seen that . \ngoing into this film , i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters ( i even expected the film to be a musical ) . \nwalking away from it , i'm kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material . \nwriter/director bille august's film version is a straightforward , beautifully told film . \nliam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean ; in the beginning , he has just been released from a 19-year prison sentence . \nhe is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior . \nthe priest's words of wisdom influence him , and he makes a vow to change himself . \nnine years later , we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo ; nobody knows his real name , and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago . \nconflicts arise when inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is assigned to vigo . \nvaljean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him , and javert remembers jean to be a convict . \njavert is hell-bent on upholding the law , and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice . \nalong the way , valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman , fantine ( uma thurman ) , and vows to take care of her daughter , cosette ( played later by claire danes ) . \nles miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture . \nthe production design by anna asp is authentic and vast , and the sets don't look like sets ( they look like real towns and villages ) ; gabriella pescucci's costumes are noticeably spectacular . \nbasil poledouris' soundtrack is thick and usually well-placed ( though it does get a bit heavy at times ) . \nmany scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality , such as the climax , which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening . \naugusts keeps the story simple ( which i hear is a good thing , since the novel is so complex ) and easy to follow . \nhe manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately . \ni was also impressed that he didn't go overboard with flash and style , which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days ( such as baz luhrmann's vicious tragedy william shakespeare's romeo + juliet ) . \nthis film feels solid and whole , and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested . \nliam neeson is terrific in the main role ; neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well , and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective . \nthurman , in her small role , is very good , and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very non-glamorous role such as this one . \nrush is absolutely incredible as javert ; i don't remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here ; he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances , and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense . \ni can't be as charitable for danes , however ; though i know she is a talented actress , here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit . \nles miserables is , as i've said , a solid , intelligent motion picture . \nmy only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy , and perhaps too staged . \neach scene is grand and huge , and exploding with poledouris' score , but i didn't always want them to be . \nfor the most part , les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture . \nit's a good movie , and tells its story well , but august tends to hand-feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle . \nhowever , in a film this exciting and well-produced , a few minor flaws are easily overlooked . \n"""
1,"b'while watching wes anderson\'s rushmore , it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer , the film\'s anti-hero , was not written with jason schwartzman in mind . \nthe young actor , making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman . \nschwartzman plays max , a student who is more interested in his extra-curricular activities ( such as writing edgy plays like "" serpico "" and being president of the rushmore beekeepers ) but sees his grades suffer as a result . \non the brink of being thrown out , he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume ( the great bill murray ) to build an aquarium ( on rushmore\'s baseball field ) in her honour . \nunfortunately for everyone involved , blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well , which gets in the way of max\'s plans to woo her . \nmax is one of the best-written characters we\'ve yet seen in the 90s , and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age . \nas everyone else has probably already pointed out , he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman ( although i was reminded more of paul from "" the wonder years "" , from a visual standpoint , at least ) . \nhopefully , if he avoids typecasting as weird , quirky loner-types he should earn himself a good career . \nbill murray is his equal as blume , displaying a depth we haven\'t yet seen from him . \nwhile this isn\'t his best performance ( that honour goes to groundhog day ) he is still terrific here . \nwilliams isn\'t given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray , but still does fine work . \nrushmore seems to go just a little too long but , while it isn\'t a perfect film , it is a definate must-see for anyone who wants to see that rarity , an american coming-of-age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality . \nanderson has created a modern classic with a star who should , with any luck , rise to even greater success . \n'"

' \nin this latest horror flick mimic case , it's 'never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals' instead , as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience . \nthe film begins in new york , where we see children dying from a mysterious disease , which is being carried by cockroaches . \ndr . susan tyler ( sorvino ) creates a genetically enhanced bug ( the 'judas' breed ) , however , which is designed to kill all cockroaches . \nthe bug does it's job , the cockroaches all die , and the terror is gone . \n'three years later' appears on the screen , and we discover that the judas breed is back , bigger than ever , and ready to kill . \nthe spin on this bug , however , is that it can mimic it's predator , and in this case . . . . it's \nhumans . \nthat should teach us for squishing all those bugs . \nwhat should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere , tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued , almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace . \nperhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking , and trying to avoid the 'predator' type movie it could easily have become . \nif it is , then the director and writers have made the wrong move , because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest . \nthe director , who bought us cronos , a far superior film , directs the film in a calm , and frankly dull movie . \nthere are few exciting sequences , instead just a lot of people talking . \nif the dialogue was intelligent , then it would be all right , but it's sadly babbling nonsense . \nin fact , the script is embarrsingly weak , and the characterizations not much better . sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come , with the script not bothering to develop them . \nthere is some action in this film , but it's directed in such an annoying way , it's just infuriating to watch . \nthe camera cuts all over the place , disoreitating the audience , and instead of involving the audience in the action , it merely alienates them . \nthe peformances are o . k , if slightly below average . \nsorvino is o . k , although she's not very good at conveying terror , or anything emotion really . \nthe supporting cast are all sterotypes , with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth , a geeky scientist with spectacles , and what could be the most stereotypical mexican 'old timer' ever . \ntheir reasonable good fun , however . \nmimic , then , may fail with it's story , pacing and characters , but the film does look good . \nlike dark city , mimic is a definite case of style of content . \nit may be a bit too gloomy for it's own good , but the sets look nice , and parts of the film are directed well . \nbut looks aren't good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre , somewhere where it shouldn't really belong . \na good opportunity , then , wasted . \na shame . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock ? 1998 \n"""
1,"b""although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama 'the sopranos , ' analyze this is witty and entertaining enough to be a good movie in it's own right . \nbilly crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol , who new 'patient' happens to be gangster boss paul vitti ( de niro . ) \nben wants nothing to do with vitti , as he's about to get married to laura macnamara ( kudrow ) and having a gangster as a patient wouldn't really help . \nbut ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds , and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out . \nall done in a comic fashion , of course . \nalthough never brilliant , analyze this is also never rubbish , which makes for a fun ride . \nbilly crystal , who hasn't had a good role since city slickers way back in the early '90's , is given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act . \nhe's pretty funny while he does it , and although his character is a little close to his character in city slickers , he's pretty funny . \nrobert de niro is hilarious as vitti , playing it dead straight but coming off as really funny . \nhe's a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine . \nlisa kudrow , barely seen as crystals' estranged wife to be , basically reprises her phoebe role from t . v series friends , which is getting rather tiresome , and doesn't come off well on the screen . \nthe supporting cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of casino and goodfellas , and are all funny caricatures , especially vitti's bodyguard jelly ( joe viterelli . ) \nthe film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie , but with laughs instead of hard ass talking . \nit sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film , but it strangely fits in . \nspoofs are made of famous gangster movies , including a nice parody of the godfather . \nthe italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun . \nthere's also some odd plot points : fbi guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason . \nit is true that analyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history , and perhaps the plot points were expanded in a earlier version of the script . \nunfortunately , this is hollywood , so we will never know . \nharold ramis , best known as egon from ghostbusters , has a deft touch with directing comedy , as shown in the immortal groundhog day , and the less immortal caddyshack . \nall the comic potential in a scene is dug out and presented to the audience . \nthe script , written by ramis along with peter tolan and ken lonergan , starts off funny , remains funny for the most of the film , but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory . \nthe film is short , however , and just before audience interest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather rushed and unsatisfying ending and the credits roll . \nanalyze this is a good comedy , and is certainly worth watching . \nrobert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it , even though it does seem forced , or like a parody ( although i think this was intentional . ) \ncrystal is his most likeable in years , kudrow is given as little screen time as possible , which is a good thing , and de niro is just awesome . \nit's no goodfellas , and it probably won't be remembered as much as groundhog day , but analyze this is a well done comedy that won't leave you feel cheated . \n"""

1,"b' "" love is the devil "" is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist\'s psyche rather than the artist\'s lifeline . \nwatching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter . \neverything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film\'s subject , looked at it personally . \nbut while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what\'s going on . \nexactly what was i looking at ? \nwatching this film , i wasn\'t sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous . \ndirected ( and written ) by john maybury , "" love is the devil "" is stylish masterpiece for the senses . \neverything looks originally bizarre and perplexing . \nthe camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close . \nthe editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon\'s world and psyche . \nas such , there is no real story . \ni\'ve not heard much about francis bacon that i didn\'t read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like . \nhe was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty . \nas played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he\'s like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero . \nhe lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him . \nit\'s as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( "" champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , "" he says one night at the bar he frequents ) . \n "" love is the devil "" chronicles the latter part of his life . \nbacon , well-known in his mid-life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor . \nhe walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig ) . \nbacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning . \ngeorge agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason . \nthe film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another . \nwhile creating bacon\'s world of friends ( like "" high art , "" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant . \nbacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn\'t understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings . \nwhile watching this , that\'s basically all i thought was there . \nthe film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about . \nonce the film is over , it\'s easier to piece it together . \ni kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was . \nsomeone doesn\'t merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in . \nthinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother . \ni thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer\'s head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein\'s "" battleship potemkin "" ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain . \nhe drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn\'t for george . \ni guess that explains the title . \na bit . \nthat\'s great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning . \ni wish it hadn\'t reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way ) . \nor maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man\'s twisted pysche . \nit\'s almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man\'s uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience\'s throat . \nthat way you don\'t reduce your film to something it\'s just not . \ni can\'t say i totally enjoyed "" love is the devil , "" though . \ndespite all of the things i respect about this movie , it\'s still rather uncomfortable to sit through . \neven at a normally trite length of ninety minutes , the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through , especially after an exhausting first hour . \nthough hypnotic , it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times , as if it were taking advantage of one man\'s truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it . \nas such , i respect the way the film looks . \nit\'s beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that , along with "" what dreams may come "" and "" dark city , "" it\'s the year\'s most visually stunning film . \nin fact , if a better script had been forged , i\'d almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film , complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever . \nand with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi , it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs . \ni just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance . \nthen i would have had something to hold me over even now . \n'"

1,"b'it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst3k : tm . \nhe had never seen any episodes of the show , and i have watched a scant few , due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes . \nfor those of you not familiar with the premise , dr clayton forrester ( beaulieu ) wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public . \nto achieve this , he ( in the words of the tv series\' theme , which is missing in the movie ) "" bumped [mike nelson ( nelson ) ] on the noggin and then shot him into space "" , and is monitoring nelson\'s reactions to the movies he is forced to endure . \nrather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies , nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions , tom servo and crow t . robot . \nthe format of the show consists of nelson , servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched , and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love , the ship on which our heroes are marooned . \nonly two things are different in the movie : the absence of forrester\'s sidekick , tv\'s frank , and the slower pace of the jokes . \nthis latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke . \nfor their big screen outing , the producers have chosen "" this island earth "" , a 1954 classic , and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill . \nunfortunately for that film ( but making it ideal mst3k fodder ) , acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which , by today\'s standards , are less than impressive . \nnelson & co . make jokes about everything from japan\'s dominance in the world market , to star trek , to the state of disrepair of seattle\'s kingdome , and most of them work . \nunfortunately , the segments set outside the satellite\'s movie theater seem out of place and aren\'t particularly funny , but at least they\'re fairly short . \nthe big question about this movie though is : why ? \ni presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series ( rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago ) , but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen -- there are no special effects to dazzle you , no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat , and no use of digital surround sound . \nso , it seems pointless to spend $8 per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for $3 , and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts . \nnevertheless , mst3k : tm provides more laugh-out-loud opportunities than any film you\'re going to see this year , and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse . \ngiven its uniqueness , i hesitate to grade it against other films , but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of "" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad b-movies "" it does well . \n'"
1,"b""upon taking a seat at the theater , and surveying the crowd , i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises . \ni'm twenty-two , but have been accused of looking sixteen . \nyet as the film began , any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five close-knit , yet troubled sisters . \ndirector pat o'connor ( inventing the abbots , circle of friends ) weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss , need , and the bonds between five sisters . \nthe family is ruled by kate ( meryl streep ) , an unconsciously strict schoolteacher , who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family . \nthere is very little background given to the viewer , as we are thrust into a tense but loving home . \nsquabbles take place one after the other , caused by years and years of history . \nperhaps one of the best things about this film , is its naturalness . \nno situation is over-wrought , and characters react as real people do , to real problems . \nthis probably is a result of the film being from a stage play . \nthe play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright . \nwhat seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples , both in lughnasa and africa . \nin fact , dance seems to be the glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their closeness . \nlegs tap , and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster . \nonly after the music stops , and the characters stand breathing heavily do we sense any trouble . \nin the quiet after the music we muse that it's sad that music has to cease , and families falter . \nthe movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy , the narrator of the movie , as a young child flying a kite . \nhe trips over a bump and loses hold of his string , and the kite floats off farther into the distance . \ndrawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained , and at another glance mischievous . \nthe mundy family itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite , and kate's hold of the family isn't strong enough to hold off the winds of change . \nas michael stands , staring at his kite fly away , we hear the adult michael , looking back at the season that his world changed forever . \nthe movie is not overpowering , but it gives us a beautiful window into the life , love , and trouble of a household of lonely women . \nnote : this is the first movie review i've ever written , any responses on it would be greatly appreciated . \n : ) \n"""
0,"b'paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i\'d consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who\'s managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils . \nstarship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that\'s nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage . \nit\'s not a completely successful film , but as a failure it\'s certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one . \nmy favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven\'t yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight ) . \ni believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that\'s as touching as schwarzenegger\'s in t2 . \nthat movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics . \nits violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience . \nthere\'s a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him . \nhe tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim\'s every fearful tic . \nit\'s a startling moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir . \nin hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won\'t shut up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on . \nbut why ? \nhis character is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who\'s always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster . \nthe kind who just won\'t die . \nhollow man\'s protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who\'s saddled with the film\'s worst lines ( "" i\'ve lost cohesion again !

0,"b'i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world . \nand i wish that film-makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how _not_ to do it . \nwriter/director daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul-searching in this tale of seth warner ( aidan quinn ) , a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires country-western lyrics : his pregnant wife drowns , his home is destroyed by a tornado , he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning . \nconvinced that god has broken his half of the covenant , seth decides to break his , and sets out to turn every "" thou shalt not "" of the ten commandments into a "" thou shalt "" ( and vice versa ) . \nhis wife\'s sister rachel ( "" friends "" \' courteney cox ) wants to help seth ; rachel\'s selfish husband harry ( anthony lapaglia ) , who tends to break a few commandments of his own , thinks seth is a lunatic . \nthus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion . \ntaplitz isn\'t interested in treating seth\'s tragedies as genuinely tragic , making it impossible to sympathize with him . \ncomposer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds , turning seth\'s sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark ; quinn\'s performance as seth is all wild-eyed fervor without any genuine pain . \nthe actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought , with one through five dispatched in a five-minute montage . \nthe result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high-concept movie plot . \nit\'s not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth . \ncorporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has , while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seth\'s "" false witness .

1,"b'contact is a film that tries to do several different things . \nit is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) . \nthe film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals . \nthe portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv\'s the x-files . \nthe aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else . \nthey know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person . \nthe film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters\' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick\'s 2001 : a space odyssey . \nmost of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens . \nscientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between . \nthe debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway\'s atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind\'s representative to another species . \nthe film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed . \nstill , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society . \nthe two "" sides "" are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists . \npalmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology . \nthen again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions . \ncontact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself . \nthe film\'s one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss . \nfor one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction . \nthe romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss\'s explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( "" i guess you could say i\'m a man of the cloth , but without the cloth "" ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development . \ninstead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments . \ngranted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers\' part more than anything else . \nthe successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures . \neven if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn\'t ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film . \ncontact doesn\'t quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable . \nand i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction . \n'"
0,"b'the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could\'ve been effective . \nsuch is the case with _urban legend_ , the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks . \nthe idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends . \nexamples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house . \nthe killer wears one of those l . l . bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up , so you can\'t see the face . \ni guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days . \nanyhow , the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric . \nit\'s a very good setup that promises more chills to come . \nunfortunately , the film never takes off from there . \nthe movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus . \nlike most slasher flicks , this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac ( or in this case an axe wielding maniac ) . \ni\'ve always wondered why these killers don\'t save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill . \nafter the fine first scene , the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying you-thought-it-was-the-killer-but-was-just- someone-else scares . \nthese are always accompanied by loud bursts of music . \ni guess sudden , sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days . \nthe actual killer will attack at about every third music blast . \nthe slasher appears , attacks , the victim is eviscerated , and the tedious cycle appears anew . \nfalse scares should always be used in moderation . \nsomeone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just aren\'t as scary as they used to be . \nthis movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit--it\'s not frightening . \nremember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in _scream_ and _scream 2_ ? \nthis movie still adheres to them . \ntons of illogical moments about ; more than i really have the inclination to list . \nand i don\'t mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense . \nthat type of illogical can be fun . \nthis film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember . \nthe last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you\'ll be laughing more than you\'ll be screaming . \nactually , you won\'t be screaming at all . \nat its best , the acting can barely be called "" adequate "" and the script could\'ve definitely used a rewrite or two . \nthe film still manages to have some strong points . \nthe killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans . \nthere are some intentionally funny moments . \n ( these were exceeded by the unintentional ones . ) \nthe film is well made from a technical standpoint . \nbesides the first part , there is also another good scene , a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station . \nif there had only been more sequences like this , that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music , _urban legend_ might\'ve been worth your money . \n'"
0,"b'it\'s almost amusing to watch 21-year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potter\'s follow-up to 1997\'s the tango lesson , the man who cried . \nthe gen-y actress , with her cold stare and big , black eyes , has appeared in an impressive range of films ; but she doesn\'t even come close to being the bold heroine the film , set against the historical backdrop of world war 2 , requires her to be . \nricci , whose character is shockingly silent and blank , showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern , shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett : quite an amusing sight to behold . \nblanchett\'s lola , a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie , is bold , interesting and layered ? everything our heroine lacks . \nco-star of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy , blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci , sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe . \nthe actress inhabits the role ? as she always so remarkably does ? with a fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the film\'s lead rather than her dull companion . \nimportant historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film ; these landmarks serve as the film\'s little conflict . \nobviously , the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events , whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues . \nthe man who cried has many aspirations , none of which come full circle by the film\'s close . \nthere are forced messages here and there : "" go forward ; always go forward , "" lola preaches to suzie ; there\'s romance between suzie and a fellow target of hitler\'s nazis , the gypsy cesar ( johnny depp , who , like ricci , barely gets to speak ) ; lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it ; and at the core of all these devices lies suzie\'s desire to travel to america , where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago . \nthe film\'s main problem is that potter isn\'t skilled enough to tell the epic-sized story of suzie . \nthe time period\'s instability , the conflicting social classes , the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life : serving as both writer and director , potter throws in some of each , but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any . \nby the time the sigh-inducing climax hits , the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater . \nthe film\'s falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely ; are we really meant to believe any of this could happen ? \ncontrastingly , in its moving final scene , the man who cried strikes a note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film . \nalthough it\'s apparent that potter can\'t grasp what she reaches , i\'m puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place . \nricci\'s suzie is meant to be the film\'s core : from the extended flashback at the film\'s beginning to the quickly drawn ending , everything seen in the film , in some way , relates to her . \nso why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals ? \nthe character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble , but not present enough for the film to be ricci\'s . \nthe almost constant lack of flow and one-note tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha vierny\'s beautiful cinematography that renders the film\'s various locations wonderfully . \nalso worthy of note are lindy hemming\'s costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely . \nand then there\'s the music . \nfrom minute one to minute ninety-seven , there\'s hardly a moment when the wavering , skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music don\'t undercut the action ; the notes stricken both overwhelm ( particularly john turturro , portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio , whose money and reputation catch lola\'s interest ) and accompany ( oftentimes , the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the film\'s characters and reinforce that state ) . \npotter obviously cares much about each and every musical note ; unfortunately , the same effort isn\'t given towards ( almost ) everything else . \n'"
1,"b'there is a striking scene early in "" city of angels , "" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise . \nthe camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black . \nthen the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up . \nyou see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch . \nit is an important scene for several reasons . \nfirst of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible . \nthe film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference . \nthere are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like "" angels in the outfield "" ( 1994 ) or "" michael "" ( 1996 ) . \nthe angels here are stark and believable . \nthis early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god\'s angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air . \nthere is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well . \nthey eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven . \nlike human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure . \n "" city of angels "" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) . \nhe first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven . \nmaggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies . \nangels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it\'s not enough . \nhe wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance . \nhe learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to "" fall "" and become human . \nhe learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( "" n . y . p . d . \nblue "" ) in a touching and humorous performance . \nsitting at a diner together , franz tells cage\'s character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person\'s skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children . \nof course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it . \n "" city of angels "" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender\'s haunting 1988 film "" wings of desire . "" \nwenders\' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened . \nthe americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human . \nand , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn\'t suffer extensive damage . \nthis may be because director brad silberling ( "" casper "" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( "" blink "" ) wanted to make "" city of angels "" its own movie - inspired by "" wings of desire , "" but not an attempt to copy it . \nand yet , "" city of angels "" is not a typical hollywood movie . \nit is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( "" the english patient "" ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world . \nseale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by . \nwhile the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . \nboth cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances . \nryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . \ncage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . \nwhat is most striking about "" city of angels "" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . \nit\'s not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . \nit doesn\'t give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . \ninstead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive . \n____________________________________________ visit "" charlie don\'t surf !

1,"b'the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . \nlives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment\'s notice . \nthe negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . \nmost of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . \nit takes a pretty smart person to do that . \nbut what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? \nwhat if he\'s also able to think on his feet ? \nin fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? \nit is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray\'s the negotiator . \nin this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . \nwhen his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman\'s home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . \nfaced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain\'s office . \ni don\'t quite remember if the captain actually said , "" i hate to do this , but . . . "" , \nalthough it wouldn\'t surprise me if he did . \nluckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . \nafter being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . \nwalsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . \nalthough roman\'s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . \njackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . \nthe actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . \nthe script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . \nhow can we believe he\'s going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? \nunfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it\'s would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson\'s acting ability . \nalmost every time he\'s in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . \nwhen spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . \nhis is an interesting character . \nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . \n "" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can\'t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , "" he says . \nwhen he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . \nsoon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . \nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . \nas the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . \ngray really lucked out with this cast . \ndavid morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . \nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . \nin l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . \nwith the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . \nalso in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . \nhis character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . \nfortunately , this doesn\'t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . \nj . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . \nsadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . \nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . \nfor one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . \nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . \nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . \nin the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it\'s reality . \nwe\'re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . \nas an audience , we\'re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we\'d like to see if one will dominate the film . \nboth provide some pretty good entertainment . \n'"

0,"b""this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle . \ntarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far . \nbadly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves . \ni have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie . \nfurthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence . \nand , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production . \nof course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line . \nimagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like . \nwith its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse . \nanyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect . \nthe only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors ) . \nthe film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough . \ninstead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) . \nhe is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble . \nmeanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization . \non the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals . \none shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help . \nwith lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born . \nits patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability . \nwith his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal . \nhis pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off . \njane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her . \nsome six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover . \nsince then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency . \ntarzan continues this trend . \nmarch may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can't act . \nmeanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy . \ninstead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance . \nthe story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies . \nthe problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless . \nthe romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane's presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance . \nthe special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production ) . \nand , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals . \nover the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material . \nthe most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) . \nweismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number . \nand , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 . \n"""

0,"b'tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . \nthe film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it\'s evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . \nenduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . \nthe qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . \ntectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . \nit\'s not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , "" look ! \nart !

0,"b'by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer , it\'s possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one . \naction lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup . \naudience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film\'s sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending , which is an insulting cop-out . \nsomewhere out there , maybe there\'s a small cadre of film-goers who will appreciate sphere\'s dubious charms , but i\'m not among them . \ni sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie ( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham ) , because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by , it\'s hard to understand why the rights were optioned . \nsphere is the kind of first- class mess that only a top-line director with an a-list cast can create . \nwith expectations high ( and how could they not be , considering that another barry levinson/dustin hoffman collaboration , the excellent wag the dog , is still playing in theaters ? ) , \nsomething this bad can\'t help but look even worse . \nthe last time a big-name , big-budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year\'s batman & robin , and everyone knows how that movie was received . \nsphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron\'s the abyss , but , somewhere along the way , it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort , event horizon . \nscience and philosophy , which are used to good effect during sphere\'s first hour , give way to mindless , confusing action sequences . \nattempts at characterization fall apart . \nintelligent writing , which is evident early on , is replaced by hackneyed drivel . \nspecial effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness . \nbut all that is just in preparation for the ending , which is inexcusably awful . \nthis is the time-honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect . \ni left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film . \nthere is some promise , but it\'s all in the setup . \nwe\'re introduced to norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) , a psychologist who once wrote a $35 , 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered . \nwhen one is found in the middle of nowhere , 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean , norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee . \non the team with him are beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist who was once his student and lover ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ; ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology ; and harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , the government operative in charge of the mission . \ntogether , the five descend into the bowels of the ocean , where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact . \nfor a while , sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man-meets-alien situation . \nthe overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists ( such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship , apparently from the future ) offer intriguing possibilities . \nthen , right around the one-hour mark ( that\'s the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever\'s left of titanic ) , the virtually non-stop action begins , and , once it starts , the script becomes superfluous . \nthis might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension , but , instead , he relies on loud , overbearing music , strange camera angles , and quick cuts to make things "" exciting . "" \nadditionally , because none of the characters are well-formed ( a common failing in anything penned by crichton , who\'s more interested in technology than people ) , viewers don\'t develop much of a rooting interest . \nit makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience . \nwhat about that a-list cast ? \nnot surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l . jackson , but his harry isn\'t a person ; he\'s a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue . \ndustin hoffman isn\'t lively or particularly good -- it\'s ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade , has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination ( for wag the dog ) . \nsharon stone and peter coyote are both flat . \ntheir characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective . \nthen there\'s queen latifa , who , despite getting fifth billing in the credits ( ahead of liev schreiber , who boasts at least quadruple her screen time ) , has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count . \ni like to think that levinson and hoffman , recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be , chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance ( the low-budget picture was filmed during sphere\'s lengthy pre-production phase ) . \nif that\'s the case , forgiveness is granted . \ni\'m less inclined to look favorably upon crichton , although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume ( jurassic park and the levinson-directed disclosure come to mind ) . \neven if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process , crichton\'s credit as a producer disallows him absolution . \nhe was a willing participant in a creative travesty . \nno wonder sphere is being released in february , in the midst of the early year\'s cinematic wasteland . \nit deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic , which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth-consecutive weekend atop the box office heap . \n'"
0,"b'synopsis : cro-magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion . \nreluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate . \ncomments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies . \nshe proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner . \nthe clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title . \nnot even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese . \nit\'s so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it\'s oddly fascinating . \nthe ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out . \nthe clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m . auel . \nto this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following . \ni remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother . \ni have never read this book , but i sure hope it\'s 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation . \nif not , then i\'m at a complete loss to explain its popularity . \nthe clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene . \na young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e . t . , \ntramps about in the woods . \nwith her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience\'s expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered . \nwhat follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla\'s mother ( a blonde with fur pants . . . er , \nleggings ) . \ntearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera . . . well , \nas the earthquake slowly recedes . \na hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven . \ni won\'t detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point . \nthis movie is really stupid . \nit never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief . \nalso , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston . \nthe movie doesn\'t just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four . \na blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs . \nshe\'s of the "" new people "" ; they\'re of the "" old people "" with "" the memories . "" \nyep . \nwe get it . \nwe get it . \nthe clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me . \nthe movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing . \nas stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time . \nthe rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt . \nthe face-painting that\'s occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind . \nthis movie also suffers from its new age trappings . \nmaybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music . \nadd to this the film\'s faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you\'d expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious . \nthe clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it\'s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i\'ve seen in quite a while . \nit contains several scenes of sex sans nudity . \nthe violence mostly consists of hunting scenes . \nthe funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear . \nthe bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about . \nalthough this may sound gratuitous , i\'m sure , it\'s so cheesy that it probably won\'t bother most people . \nthe clan of the cave bear is a bad movie . \nhowever , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality . \ntypically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind . \nthe clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it\'s so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) . \ni have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ; however , i\'m only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie . \ni shudder to think that it could be otherwise . . . \n'"
0,"b'this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont\'s debut as a director , 1994 surprise hit speed . \nbut the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead . \nannie ( sandra bullock ) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again . \nshe\'s going on a cruise with her new boy-friend alex ( jason patric ) , and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger ( willem dafoe ) who has a bone to pick with the shipping line . \nthey sacked him after he got sick . \nnow he wants the diamonds stored in the ship\'s safe for compensation . \nthat actually is the whole storyline . \nspeed 2 could do without dialogues . \nthe movie is all about images and remarkable sound . \ni don\'t really know why this is called an action movie . \nexcept for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies . \nfirst we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie . \nthen desaster strikes . \nsandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around . \ni looked for the "" action "" but couldn\'t find it . \nmost of the time she is part of the decoration . \nthe only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door . \nnow we know that she can handle a chain saw . \nwe also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds . \nthe bomb defusal of course goes wrong , but only the furniture is damaged , not our heroes who still are needed . \njason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie , helping other passengers and frolicking in the water . \nhis initial sea-sickness is suddenly gone , because there are ship , crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger . \nhe does a pretty good job but i can\'t blame keanu reeves for declining this part . \nthen there\'s willem dafoe , the villain , who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein\'s monster . \nhe doesn\'t succeed , though . \nan untidy appearance isn\'t enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential . \nbefore he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror . \ni can\'t really recommend speed 2 . you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren\'t meant to be funny . \nespecially the showdown , when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat . \nthere you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie . \nin keeping with last year\'s desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death . \na really funny ( and meant to be funny ) scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision . \nsome crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie . \nhad they looked out the window they wouldn\'t have missed the huge ship racing toward them . \nthose of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects . \nin an adequately equipped theater it\'s as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate . \nbut the ilm special effects can\'t save the movie . \nfor all the money they could have done better . \n'"
0,"b'capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace . \nthere is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise . \njohn carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films , especially assault on precinct 13 , that the new film comes off as his homage to himself . \n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) . \njohn carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes . \nfor a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make . \nghosts of mars is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace . \nin addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars , carpenter would have grounds to sue . \nthis film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness . \nit is , in fact , surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way . \nbut that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience . \nghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 . \nmars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film\'s budget ) . \nit is never mentioned , but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal , again making it easier to film . \nsociety has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little . \napparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control . \nand from carpenter\'s view , women have really made a mess of things . \nsociety has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten . \nthe basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony . \ninstead of having the criminal "" napolean "" wilson , this film has the criminal "" desolation "" williams . \ninstead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars . \nbecause the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination . \nthe story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback . \nghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black . \ncarpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat . \nsadly what follows is not really up to the buildup . \nthe terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss . \nhis idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring . \nthese are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience . \nsomewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights . \nwithin a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars , red planet , and ghosts of mars . \nafter mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by . \ni rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nfollowing the movie i showed my wife , who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did , carpenter\'s classic assault on precinct 13 . \nher comment is that it was seeing the same film twice . \n'"

1,"b' "" the tailor of panama "" is a different kind of spy movie . \ndespite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here . \ninstead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation . \nbased on the novel by john le carr ? , who also co-wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well-told story . \nbrosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice . \nhis british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement . \nosnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new home base . \nwhen shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning . \nbrosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end . \nsearching for a way to get information on the government , osnard sets his sights on harry pendel ( geoffrey rush ) , an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite . \nharry claims to be a transplant from britain\'s renowned saville row , but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle\'s shop in an insurance scam . \nhe also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt , having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm . \nosnard offers harry a way out . \nhe will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele . \neager to comply , harry offers what he knows , then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing . \nbefore long , he is forced to spy on his loving wife , louisa ( jamie lee curtis ) , an aide to the canal director . \nharry\'s little lies build , eventually taking on a life of their own . \nosnard turns in reports about the "" silent opposition , "" a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal . \nthe bogus revelation proves explosive , leading to meetings in washington d . c . over how to best protect the vital waterway . \nmeanwhile , osnard wallows in his newfound status , enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co-worker . \nand harry grows ever more fretful , fearing the consequences if his clients , not to mention his wife , learn about his lies . \ngeoffrey rush is wonderful as harry , fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings , all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor . \nrush makes harry a credible figure , presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity . \nafter gaining fame playing larger than life characters , rush flips everything around for this role , using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems . \nalthough she gets far too little screen time , jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her . \nof the central characters , she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self-confidence . \ncurtis is one of my favorite female actors ; whiplash smart , sultry and charismatic , she deserves more than supporting roles . \nspeaking of supporting characters , there are some great ones here . \nharold pinter is amusing as harry\'s uncle benny , who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways . \nalso shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker , who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr . strangelove school of armed patriotism . \nbut the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson , both outstanding as two wounded activists . \ntheir presence adds weight to the story , reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men , there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal . \ndirector john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location . \ninstead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop , he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there . \nthe metropolis , described by one character as "" casablanca without heroes "" pulsates with life , underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people . \n "" the tailor of panama "" succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment . \n'"
1,"b'carry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion . \nmade in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre . \nsid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr . goode . \nthe jokes come in fast and so do the laughs , with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard . \nthis time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr . goode . \nthe doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : - "" i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other ! "" \nbernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself . \nthere are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he\'s at work ( at the railway station ) . \nsid james\' gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home . \nhe has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and she soon sees through him ! \nthe film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital\'s pills with panic ensuing . \nthere are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron , however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous \'matron\'s\' . \nwilliams is , as usual , on top form , but sid james isn\'t given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all . \nthe same does not go for charles hawtrey , for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time , he seems to steal every scene he is in . \nby not making use of sid james and barbara windsor\'s talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it\'s good storyline and it\'s other appealing characters . \nthis film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored ! \n'"
0,"b' "" goodbye , lover "" sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may , and one look will tell you why . \nit\'s a mess . \nand that\'s * way * before ellen degeneres shows up . \nthe film is one of those torrid double-indemnity crime stories that , in this case , required the services of three screenwriters . \ni suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller , one wrote a murder mystery , and one wrote a comedy , then director roland joff ? tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment . \ni didn\'t laugh at ellen degeneres much ( i think i was supposed to ) . \ndegeneres is horrible and her character is even worse , a tough-talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair . \neither degeneres is wearing a wig--as most of the actors appear to be--or she doesn\'t yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist . \nevery single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip , but her incessant wisecracking is poorly-written and merely stupid . \nher reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is "" at least she died healthy .

"" \nthat being said , _the caveman\'s valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart . \nthe difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman\'s valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane\'s spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts . \nit is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus\' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself . \nwhether or not romulus of _the caveman\'s valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman\'s valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far . \nit , along with m . night shyamalan\'s _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller\'s seminal "" the dark knight returns "" , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics . \nreaders of sam keith\'s brilliant "" the maxx "" comic series ( or of mtv\'s short-lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne . \nthe failure of both "" the maxx "" tv show and of _the caveman\'s valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america\'s surprising contributions to dark fantasy . \nluxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic-panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer\'s ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman\'s valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film . \nkasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve\'s bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering . \n_the caveman\'s valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape . \nclearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post-modern audience with urine-stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes . \n_the caveman\'s valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot\'s rat\'s alley wasteland . \n'"

1,"b'after a rather disappointing "" mary railly "" , stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise . \nthis is one of the best surprises of this season -- a sweet , small budget comedy with a big heart . \nin fact it\'s not even a comedy . \nit\'s a drama or even more precise -- a clever satire on human relationships and needs . \nbased on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby , ``high fidelity\'\' is a wry and likable story about a man\'s quest for fulfillment and happiness . \nrob gordon was a dj . \nit seems that he could make everything spin -- except his own life . \nnow he owns championship vinyl , a little musical store , somewhere in new york . \nwhen he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend , a gorgeous blond attorney , life suddenly looses every purpose . \ndecimated , humiliated and on the verge of a mental ( and emotional ) breakdown , he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been -- about what\'s right and what\'s important . \nhe starts "" categorizing "" life , dividing it into "" top 5 lists "" . \nand the most important is the "" top 5 list "" over the most painful breakups of his life , starting with 5th grade , when he found his young girlfriend with another boy . \nthough you might think that people change , grow more mature with age , it just doesn\'t seem that way and all rob\'s relationships were different versions of that first . \nwhere did he go wrong ? \nwas it he that screwed up ? \nor maybe life just stinks ? \nwhile he is lost in his own self-pity , he must think of the "" top 5 list "" over his needs for the future , find the right elements and mix his life together . \nwith clever parallels to the cult of celebrity , music and with incredibly direct narration , it addresses the average audience member , in other words -- people like you and me . \nalthough a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and frears , the director , the acting is equally important as the written word . \nand here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned . \nhe is simply superb . \nit is as much his movie as it is frears\' . \nthe film would not be the same without him . \ncusack -- whose character is sadder , wiser and 35 -- brings intelligence and warmth to post- mod irony . \nmost of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera -- not an easy task -- but cusack pulls it off . \nhis interpretation feels so emotionally right , so incredibly realistic and precise that frears\' message simply can\'t be ignored or overseen . \nthe other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job . \nboth ______ and jack black are fabulous . \neven catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts , not just looks beautiful . \nhowever , the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob\'s co-worker and friend dick . \nthis is such an impressive achievement that it\'s almost worth a oscar-nomination . \nhe is simply a joy to behold . \notherwise , everyone are in their place , and at the right time -- all part of frears\' colorful blend . \npretty much like edward norton\'s "" keeping the faith "" , this film doesn\'t follow any formula or belong to any genre -- it\'s dramatic , tragic , sarcastic , comic and even cynical , but never bitter or angry . \nit\'s a little bit of everything , pretty much like life itself . \nnothing seems unreal or staged . \nit reflects reality as a mirror . \nas you watch it , you go through the same emotional problems as the main character . \nyou feel and think and reflect . \nthis effect has become a rarity nowadays . \nalthough it\'s primarily about the perils of love , ``high fidelity\'\' is secondarily about pop music . \nrob owns championship vinyl and his employees , timid dick ( todd louiso ) and overbearing barry ( jack black ) , are fellow music snobs . \nmusic is the language in their lives , the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives . \nand so does the movie . \nit is as much a musical film as anything else , as rob\'s journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments . \nin the end , you have gained something while watching it . \nit\'s not the film of the century or even of the year . \nit\'s not an special effects extravaganza . \nit doesn\'t require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed . \nit\'s a small movie about the big things . \nand even though it does not contain heavy philosophy , you feel as if you have experienced something of significance , and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time . \n'"
1,"b'here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . \nokay , it isn\'t quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart . \nmost films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them . \nhowever , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered . \na lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash . \nbut , the thing is , it isn\'t . \nit\'s well made , well acted , and quite intelligent . \ni can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film . \nbut the species series isn\'t about the lack of these elements . \nit\'s about how much it can get into one film . \nand yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so . \nspecies ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe . \nmany films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film\'s needs . \nspecies ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars . \naboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut . \npatrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed . \nwell , it would seem that he has succeeded . \nlanding on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so . \nof course , he isn\'t the first ever . \nabout a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life . \nnow , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky . \nno life lives on it . \nthat is , no visible life . \npatrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground . \nhe takes them aboard , and puts them in storage . \nunfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship . \njust prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings . \nthey pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can\'t even remember . \nthey blame it on a technical malfunction . \nback on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible . \nas we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet . \nhowever , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is . \npatrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) . \neve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien . \nhowever , this time around , most of her "" alien "" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant . \nthe project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable . \nsince she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again . \nand it has . \nstory-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can\'t tell me it was strong on story ) . \nwhat surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay . \nin my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles . \nthis piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) . \nthe script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot . \nbeginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie . \nand it does it quite well . \nthe characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do . \nthe only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does . \nthere are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects . \nthe special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad . \nbut for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) . \nalso , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone\'s head being blown off . \nhowever , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary . \nmany people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence . \nhowever , i tend to disagree . \nwhat were the alien films about ? \nand , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn\'t you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? \nmy only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store . \ni didn\'t realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) . \nthe acting is quite good for this kind of film . \nit is a vast improvement over the first film , at least . \nthe acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens . \nokay , so it isn\'t that good . \ngeorge dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting . \nnatasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage . \nhowever , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent . \noh yeah , and she\'s quite fun to just plain watch . \nmarg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film . \nmichael madsen is so-so , but he isn\'t annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) . \njames cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor . \nas i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability . \nmykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel . \nand , of course , justin lazard . \nlazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective . \nsure , he is wooden , but isn\'t that what his character is like ? \nthe moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple\'s acting . \nspecies ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language . \nthis is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see . \nmore than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives . \nhell , i don\'t even know if i will . \nwhat is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year . \ni probably won\'t see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . \ndirector peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . \nmedak has also mastered the wonderful "" jump ! "" \nmoments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) . \nstrong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining . \n'"
1,"b""jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway . \nin as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where . \nhe's mean . \ni mean really mean . \nthe opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium . \nevery day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress . \nyou can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe . \none day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks . \nat that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too . \nanother person who often crosses melvin's sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin's floor . \naside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target . \nsimon's friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , also gay , does not fare much better . \nwhen simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon's dog while he convalesces . \nthis is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage . \nan interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin's softening up to the world around him . \nit doesn't happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love . \none of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others . \nhe's traveling terra incognita here , and it shows . \ngood performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt . \nthey play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen . \ngreg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon . \nhe gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels . \ncuba gooding jr . performs with a hyped-up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance . \nthe screenplay , by mark andrus and james l . brooks , is clever , touching , and funny . \nthe best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting . \nmelvin is a man we can't quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention . \ncarol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem . \nsimon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society . \ncombined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film . \nthe one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr . through the second half . \nhis character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved . \ni would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film's conclusion . \nthere's one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie's best scenes and who deserves mention . \nthis is that little dog . \nhe plays such a pivotal role to melvin's character development , actually serves to forward the plot , and has some absolutely scene-stealing moments , that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal . \naward or no , however , when even the dog puts in a good performance , you know you've got an outstanding movie . \n"""
1,"b""as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult . \nparents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives . \nbut if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome . \n`affliction' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood . \nthe man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte ) . \nhere is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface . \nhe is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me . \nbut as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head . \nwe see that he is a mean-tempered person . \nhe has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him . \nhe is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence . \nhe also has tremendous problems with relationships . \nhe is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter . \nbut his bearish persona and stature alienates her . \nhe is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him . \nhis demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk . \nshe tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point . \nfinally , he is spiteful and vindictive . \nas a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless . \nas the town's only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died . \nwe can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain . \nhe is a prisoner and a slave to it . \nhe is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension . \nwhat kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ? \nwe learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn ) . \nthis is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet . \nhe is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist . \nwe see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks . \nto heighten the father's churlishness , the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person . \nvery effective . \ntoday , wade's dad is quite elderly , but still manages to instill fear into a grown man . \nthe influence that the father possesses is inescapable , and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade . \nthe result is every son's nightmare ? becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be . \nthis is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama , and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity . \nhe's a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father . \ncoburn displays heft as the bitter dad . \nbut , it's most certainly not saturday-night-friendly fare . \nthere's nothing light or fluffy about this film . \nthat may turn many moviegoers away . \nbut it's certainly worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing nolte's and coburn's raw acting talents . \n"""
1,"b'no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , "" jude the obscure , "" his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life . \nbut , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is . \n "" jude "" is a satirical film from start to finish about society\'s way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but what\'s remarkable is how timeless this film is . \nthe film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn\'t really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it\'d be kinda different ( a given ) . \nit tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from "" shallow grave "" ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams . \nin its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world . \nafter marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common , he moves away to a town with a giant university , with a chance to learn more , and get ahead in life . \ntaking a welding job , he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars , reciting latin over and over again , and training himself . \nbut when he sends his application for the school in , he is bluntly told to just remain a worker . \nanother reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet ) , his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher . \nshe and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends , so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) . \nseveral twists turn in the storyline , and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene , to say the least . . . ) , and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock , as she eventually gives birth to their baby , and jude inherits his son from arabella , who turns up again after awhile . \nbecause they aren\'t married , and because they\'re cousins , they run into problems with every place they go to , carrying around two children everywhere , and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time , then moving on . \nif you didn\'t think this was harsh enough , wait till you see what happens later on . . . \nthe sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world . \nhe will never gain any true happiness , and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting , and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life . \npart of it is his fault - he\'s too optimistic , and too gullible . \nbut society has a way of taking these people , and hurting them until their death . \nthe ending of "" jude "" is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i\'ll have to read it now ) . \n "" jude "" offers a satirical view on society\'s cruelties , but shows no way of curing this , and thank heavens it doesn\'t . \nthere\'s no way to relinquish the selfishness of society , and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem . \nsatire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people\'s minds , and that\'s what "" jude "" is . \nsure , it\'s one hell of a downer , but it needs to be . \nthe film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads , and some good supporting work along with it . \nchristopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully , sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face , and making him kind of child-like at other times . \nkate winslet , in a pre- "" titanic "" performance , is brilliant , nailing every psyche of her character , and creating someone who\'s troubled but very seductive with her personality . \nkate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you don\'t believe me , see "" titanic , "" branagh\'s "" hamlet , "" "" sense and sensibility , "" and "" heavenly creatures , "" the latter one being my favorite performance of hers ) . \nin the supporting roles , liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher , exposing all his bad parts , but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude\'s wife , whom he never divorces . \n "" jude "" moves at a very slow pace , and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists , which would drive some people nuts . \nbut those who appreciate good social commentary with their films , no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) will appreciate "" jude , "" though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it . \n'"

1,"b'i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory . \nthis was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this . \nnot only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie . \nthe very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city . \ngibson\'s performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films . \ngibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better . \nthe character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique . \ntry to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups . \nif you can imagine that , then you\'ve basically got jerry fletcher . \nin many ways , i was surprised by this movie . \nto begin with , i was surprised at how good it was . \ndon\'t get me wrong , it\'s not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie . \nsecondly , i was surprised at mel gibson\'s performance . \nhe provided a fantastic performance . \nthe previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense . \ngibson\'s character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film . \nfor instance , jerry\'s apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable . \nand last , i was surprised at how good the plot is . \nwriter brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher\'s far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland\'s own opinions . \nmel gibson isn\'t the only stand-out in the film . \njulia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who can\'t seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories . \nhe also seems obsessed and in love with her . \nbut whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him . \njerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) . \nalthough he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition . \nvery soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) . \nafter barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton . \nthe remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry\'s life being constantly put into jeopardy . \nand more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry\'s life . \nmany things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience . \nfor instance , the meaning of the book "" the catcher in the rye "" and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g . \nlee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead . \nmake sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above . \ndefinitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th , make sure you are standing in line to see it . \ni am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film , especially if you are into an action-thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations . \nand even if you aren\'t , you should still like this film . \n'"

1,"b""with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different . \nits structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books . \nthe parallels don't end there , either . \natlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big-screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king's dreamcatcher . \neven the film's content is a bit reminiscent of mile . \nin fact , it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile . \nking's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film's title comes from the second chapter ) . \nit's set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self-centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould's secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son . \nbobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich . \nwhen a new tenant moves into the vacant room , the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins , hannibal ) , a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby's mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror . \nted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday ) , dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men , a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers . \ni won't go into what these powers are , but they're considerably toned down from the book ( and don't involve black stuff flying out of ted's mouth , a la mile ) . \natlantis' present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel's final chapter , titled heavenly shades of night are falling , and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married , middle-aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years . \natlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks' cedars , which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski , the oscar-nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski's red . \nthe acting is solid from everyone , including hopkins , who never once makes you think of dr . lecter . \nmost impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem , who both had tiny parts in along came a spider . \nwhile i didn't really have much of a problem with goldman's screenplay , i do need to point out at least one inconsistency . \ngoldman , for those of you who don't read premiere , writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else's films , carefully explaining why they all suck , make no sense and insult their audiences , while somehow failing to mention the crap that he's penned ( like the general's daughter ) . \nit's mean-spirited but fun to read , mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson , o . j . \nand robert blake ) . \nin atlantis , which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby , one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back . \nwell , he's not , and it doesn't make sense . \n1 : 41 - pg-13 for violence and thematic elements \n"""

\ni know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre , but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror . \ncome on , the guy looks like the gorton\'s fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate . \nthough his lightning-lit appearances ellicited much-needed laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film , and that\'s * really * saying something . \nso , all that\'s left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy . \nboth prance about in tightfitting , revealing outfits or in various states of undress , yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene . \nhewitt , however , does do a post-shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite . \n . \n . titillating . \nthis scene alone made this one-star turkey earn two stars under my rating system . \notherwise , hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves . \nearly in the film , for instance , brandy wins the trip to the bahamas . \nshe and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever . \ni needed extra-strength tylenol after that part . \noh , and the film\'s conclusion , talk about repetitive ! \npeople who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know\'s ending at least 5 minutes before it happens . \nboring ! \ni saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater . \nadmission is only one dollar on wednesdays , and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them . \nit\'s usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience , who don\'t seem to mind participating in a mass "" mystery science theater 3000 "" -type viewing . \ni still know what you did last summer , however , produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience , underscoring how bad it * really * is . \nif it weren\'t for the main actresses\' revealing wardrobes , i\'d have had a very , very hard time sitting through this lame sequel . \ni can\'t imagine trying to watch it on video ( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation ) and wouldn\'t recommend it to people , unless they\'re horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy . \ni read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works . \nwhat a depressing thought . \nhewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act . \nrated r , this film contains lots of violence , several gory scenes , and a couple nubile , horny teenagers--though the sex act itself is always thwarted . \ni\'d say this is unsuitable for kids , but teens wouldn\'t have a problem sitting through it , especially since they obviously compose the film\'s target audience . \n'"

1,"b'catherine deane ( jennifer lopez ) is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up . \nshe has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma , but the boy\'s parents aren\'t happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life . \nas if trying to assure the boy\'s parents wasn\'t hard enough on her , a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane\'s mental faculties . \na vicious serial killer named carl stargher ( vincent d\'onofrio ) has been kidnapping women , locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days , then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life-sized dolls . \njust after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell , stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia . \nthe police , led by fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim\'s body , but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state . \nin a last ditch attempt , they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher\'s mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell . . . \na cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours ! \ninitial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix . \nwhile it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes , which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs ) , the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm . \nthe buzz around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r . e . m . \'s "" losing my religion "" ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story , and a good portion of this film supports that theory . \ndespite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery . \nall of the sequences where we delve into someone\'s mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher , whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h . r . giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe . \nthe first sequence that takes place in stargher\'s mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious traps i\'ve ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a zoo-like display of stargher\'s victims which are animated like marionettes , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room . \nif the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant , but alas , the sequences only become more silly as they go along ( despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film ) . \nthe cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images , but at least vincent d\'onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance ( magnified by ten , thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed ) . \nin my opinion , d\'onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film , but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful ( i . e . - \nthe newton boys , feeling minnesota , the thirteenth floor , and the velocity of gary ) that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him . \nthe character of stargher is an excellent role for him though , and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him . \ndetractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film , as it contains heavy doses of both . \nbesides the nipple ring removal i mention above , there is also stargher\'s penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs ( prior to his catatonia and capture ) which will have audiences recoiling . \na sequence where catherine enters stargher\'s mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting . \none moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit-like device . \nas a narrative film , the cell is sorely lacking . \nas a collection of images though , the cell is extremely well done . \nalthough the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half , singh has done what he supposedly set out to do : make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together . \nunfortunately , a well-written script should have been considered too , because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv ( provided , of course , that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos ) . \n'"

1,"b'i have to say it . \ntim burton\'s retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys . \nok , that\'s off my chest . \nno more monkey puns , i promise . \nseriously , though , planet of the apes is one rip-roarin\' summer outing , filled with thrills , action , adventure , wit and bits of funny ( dare i say , monkey ) business . \ni know , i know , i promised . \nand for those film buffs who are fond of the original , burton\'s version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie . \nmark wahlberg stars as capt . leo davidson , a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future . \nhe crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted , captured and sold into slavery . \ndespite being darker than the original , burton\'s film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious . \nsome of the movie\'s flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed . \nthen there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter . \nthe seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : "" one thing you don\'t want in your house is a human teen-ager , "" he says . \nyou don\'t have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement . \ntouches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton\'s brand . \nlines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian\'s foot to try righting himself are : "" take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human . "" \nanyone familiar with the first version of the film will , of course , recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue . \nanother of burton\'s in-jokes is to have charlton heston , star of the original , play the chimpanzee father of tim roth\'s gen . thade . \nthe young chimp goes to visit his dying father . \nboth have one thing in common , a hatred of humans . \nwith his dying breath , the elder spews out his vile : "" damn them , damn them all to hell , "" he says before expiring . \nthat is the famous line heston\'s taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet\'s terrible secret . \nthe performances throughout are top-notch . \nwahlberg plays davidson not as some gung-ho hero , but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home . \nhe is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet . \nthis hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable . \nroth is ferocious , cunning , cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity . \nhe leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet . \nit is a masterful turn . \nhelena bonham carter is ari , the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals . \nhers is a smart , compassionate characterization . \nmichael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken . \na fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo , the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures . \nas the battle between apes and humans looms , the cowardly limbo pleads , "" can\'t we all just get along , "" echoing the words of rodney king . \nmuch of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton\'s technical crew , especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup . \nburton\'s musical collaborator , danny elfman , provides another fine score , though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow . \nthe movie\'s only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original . \nhe comes close , but falls short . \notherwise , planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be : an amusement park ride filled with lots of action , stunts and a few laughs . \nthis is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype . \n'"
1,"b'i rented "" brokedown palace "" last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws . \nfor anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety . \nthat is no easy task . \nsuperficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably "" return to paradise "" and "" midnight express . "" \nas a result nearly every review of "" brokedown palace "" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons . \nthe consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film . \nfor those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was "" midnight express "" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of "" return to paradise . "" \nin my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad\'s acclaimed novel , "" lord jim . "" \nproblematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world "" justice "" system . \nthe girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale ) . \nthey\'re life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents . \nonce there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside . \nthey get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl\'s scam . \nhe then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene . \nby now alarm bells are going off among viewers . \nthe ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don\'t add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice . \nlong before it happens , we\'re anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin . \njust as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch . \nleft unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice . \nfor those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl\'s fleabag hotel . \nas one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer "" yankee hank "" ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife . \na recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film\'s tag lines , "" who do you trust ? , "" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman\'s oeuvre will find few surprises . \nmuch of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion . \nlou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments . \nis he part of a wider conspiracy ? \nwith an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them . \nthe result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls\' interaction , hank\'s investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape . \nif "" brokedown palace "" has a major flaw , it is its creators\' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story\'s main avenue . \nand , if that were all there was to "" brokedown palace , "" it wouldn\'t be a very good movie . \nbut i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded . \nfor the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations . \nultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing . \nyoung and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure . \npresented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale ) . \nclear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend . \nshe comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father ) . \nwhereas darlene\'s life is "" on-track , "" aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and "" fulfillment , "" alice\'s is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning . \none poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo . \ntellingly , alice is present but not included . \njust as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice\'s face doesn\'t read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while "" dar "" remains seated in the shade . \n "" brokedown palace "" begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank . \nhowever unintentional , it\'s all alice\'s fault . \nshe\'s responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick . \n ( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film\'s beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison . ) \ndar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence . \nnever mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate . \ndar is innocent . \nit doesn\'t matter . \nalice is the subject of this movie . \nshe and her journey toward personal freedom . \nalong the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half-baked sensibilities and materialistic goals . \nin the end , that culture , like its representatives , "" yankee "" hank and dar\'s father ( a "" man who knows how to grease the wheels "" ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl\'s tragedy . \nthailand\'s culture , contrary to most opinion , comes off much better by comparison . \nit amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes . \ni believe the filmmaker\'s view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior . \nthe thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles . \nthe girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native-born . \ntheir prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole , being relatively clean and sunlit . \nthe prison authorities demanded good hygiene , provided medical care when needed , and "" hard manual labor "" consisted of picking grass ! \nthe thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic . \nas for the thai justice system , the reasoning of the thai judges , during both an appeal hearing and in the film\'s penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality . \n\'freedom\' has many faces and "" brokedown palace "" explores many of them . \nin the extreme , we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit . \nsome settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter . \nbut freedom seldom comes without a price . \nwhich is why the movie\'s other tag lines are : "" what is your dream ? "" \nand "" how far would you go ? "" \ni believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom , incarcerated or not , by film\'s end is alice . \nshe finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility . \ni think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact . \nkate beckinsale\'s character might more properly be likened to the "" released "" temple bird referred to twice during the film , "" trained to fly back to its cage . "" \nas the thai magistrate observed in the film\'s climactic scene , the issue was always one of "" character ; "" and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that "" freedom "" is achieved within oneself . \nif one thinks back over the movie , which character was transformed by their experiences ? \nincreasingly , the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of \'kung fu woman\'--female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures . \nhere , at last , is the story of a modern heroine . \nin reading the many user\'s comments , i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon : whether or not a person liked the movie , almost everyone praised the actors . \nthink about that . \nwhen was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it , but raving about all the performances in it ? \ndo yourself a favor : rent "" brokedown palace "" and watch it with a open mind . \nthere\'s more there than meets the eye . \n'"
0,"b""plunkett & macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott , brother of ridley and tony . \nnaturally , this got me worried . \nwould jake's talent be inherited from ridley or tony ? \nif it was from ridley , than the movie would be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in . \nif it was from tony , it would be wham bang drivel . \nunfortunately , the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm . \ncarlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen , plunkett ( carlyle ) who is poor and unruly , and captain james macleane ( miller ) a clean cut gentleman . \nas the tagline clearly wants to make known , they rob the rich and nothing else . \nthe film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage , along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca ( tyler . ) \nhot on both their tails is mr chance ( ken stott ) who wants to see them both dead . \nplunkett & macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose . \nalthough undoubtedly slick and fast paced , there's very little merit contained in the film . \ncarlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair , although their characters are criminally undeveloped . \nit appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes , but not on the script . \nthe five ( ! ) screenwriters ( three credited ) have produced an still born movie : there's very little development in the story . \nalso , major events , such as mr . cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are , are so rushed that they barely happened . \nthe story is a bit of a mess , frankly . \nthe performances aren't bad : carlyle and miller are typical lads , but liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest . \nher irritable , stilted performance sticks out like a sore thumb , and i was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on . \nshe looks nice , though . \nmore interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester , and although his character amounts to nothing more than a two dimensional comedy gay character , he hams it up well . \nken stott is suitably evil as chance , but again he is nothing but a flat character . \ni didn't particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived . \nalthough a disappointment in writing , and a minor success in acting , the film certainly look lavish , with good costumes , and wonderful sets . \nbut production design alone can't save a movie , especially a movie as bad as this mess . \njake scott would be more suited to directing a music video rather than this failed update of a period drama : the only update seems to be the fact that everyone must talk dirty , with 'f * ck this' and 'stand and f * cking deliver' splattered all over the place . \nthe mtv editing and direction are flash enough , but in the end decidedly empty . \nplunkett & macleane is a massive disappointment . \nalthough somewhat enjoyable during parts , it's so light it could float off the screen if it wasn't just images on a reel . \nthere's no thought , no development , no plot , just a series of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to gen-xers . \nalthough it's a great idea : update a period drama to the mtv generation : it's execution is awful , and would more likely bore than excite . \nsloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless , it's hard to recommend plunkett & macleane as a movie , but easy to recommend it as a overlong music video . \ngive it a miss . \n"""
0,"b'one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek , the star of the wb\'s runaway hit dawson\'s creek . \nfollowing in the foot steps of mtv\'s two other live action films , joe\'s apartment ( 1996 ) and dead man on campus ( 1998 ) , varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace . \nset in west cannan , texas , the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john "" mox "" moxon ( van der beek ) . \nwe know he\'s smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook . \ncoach bud kilmer ( jon voight ) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him . \nthe star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , is a handsome , blonde , hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader , darcy ( ali larter ) . \nalso on the team are an enormous guy ( ron lester ) with some health problems and the token african-american team member ( eliel swinton ) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin . \nwhen lance is seriously injured , mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it , undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies . \nhis relationship with his dutiful girlfriend , jules ( amy smart ) , is threatened and there\'s a big game at the end . \nguess who wins ? \nnothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love . \nthere\'s a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow . \nvan der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes . \nalso , the role isn\'t very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character . \nhe\'s still a pseudo-intellectual , whiny , nice guy , except here he also happens to be a jock . \nvoight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out . \nthe other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don\'t fare much better . \non the positive side , walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville ( 1998 ) . \nscott ( son of james ) caan has some lively moments as tweeder , the team\'s wild man . \nlarter , as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas , gets to show off the film\'s most interesting costumes , including a very eye-opening "" whipped cream bikini . "" \nit\'s interesting to note that the film definitely earns its r-rating with a lot of harsh language , alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity ( including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise ) . \nall this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawson\'s creek , presumably the target audience for the picture . \ndirector brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger ( from nickelodeon films , a sister company of mtv ) and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression . \nthe look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it . \nthe football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out . \nthere\'s an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul , foo fighters , green day and aaliyah but it\'s not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film . \n'"
0,"b'plot outline - wendy ( samantha press ) , a jazz singer , loves mack ( hugo race ) a criminal and wanna be rock singer who\'s planning a bank heist . \nmack is also being tailed by a couple of cops , one an inexperienced rookie ( dominic sweeney ) , the other ( john flaus ) a worn out veteran who frequents wendy\'s jazz club . \nthey\'re tailing mack , because he has an audiotape that may show evidence of governmental corruption . \nmeanwhile wendy\'s sexually awakener , fifteen year old sister ( rebecca elmaloglou ) has moved in with her , and is secretly watching mack and wendy\'s late night love trysts ? much zaniness ensues \nthe review : main problem first - about 2% of rood rock star to actor conversions in filmdom ever really work . \nunfortunately , trying to cast hugo race as a violent , sexy criminal falls into the "" what the hell where they thinking "" category that takes up 98% of the rest . \nbut , hell , it\'s not as if he\'s the only problem in this well-intentioned but ultimately below average aussie thriller . \nleads , race and samantha press are wooden and dull , hampered by some unfortunate attempts at sexy dialogue early on . \nthough they do manage some heat later in their love scenes , helped , no doubt by them keeping their mouths shut . \nthe film suffers every time the story shifts back to these two . \nwhich is unfortunately , the other main story isn\'t any great shakes either . \nthe second part , concerning two cops , political corruption and that elusive tape is incredibly muddled . \nat many points during the movie i had no idea what was going on , a situation that didn\'t improve on repeated viewing . \nthere is no doubt that this film\'s achilles heel is its script . \nas for the rest of the cast , it\'s a mixed bag . \njohn flaus , one of australia\'s most criminally underused actors , is in top form as the withering , alcoholic jazz fan cop , who may or may not have sold out to the highest bidder . \nalthough he falters at one point , when the script calls for him to get up on stage and deliver a drunken beat sermon , but believe me , they way it was written , no one could have pulled it off . \ndominic sweeney is fine , though he seems to be uneasy in front of the lens but he really isn\'t given a whole lot to do . \npre home and away elmaloglou is pretty good as the inquisitive jojo , but her character seems extraneous to the story , well , at least until the final scenes . \ni must admit , in too deep does have some impressive qualities , not the least of which is it visual element . \ncinematographers mark gilfedder & peter zakharov have achieved the almost impossible by making melbourne look like a sweat drenched tropic city , which is akin to turning london into san paolo . \nthe bar is an oppressive red , like all of it\'s patrons are being baked while they drink , outside it hazy orange by day and cool blue by night . \nif only deborah parson\'s script could have supported this idea better . \nhaving two director\'s ( colin south & john tatoulis ) doesn\'t help either , the most glaring example of which is the final retribution/fight scene , where for some reason the camera pulls away from the onscreen action , and more importantly it doesn\'t pull away to anything else . \nit just stays static as the fight happens in the distance . \nit has no reason to it ; it\'s just bad direction . \nand , ultimately , that is what sums up in too deep , it\'s tries to be good , and you want it to work , but , it\'s just lacking the talent behind it , that it needs to succeed . \n'"
1,"b'in the wake of the smashing success of "" rumble in the bronx , "" it\'s looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release . \nrumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii . \nthe version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it\'s widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days . \navailability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng . \nthe subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small . \nalthough the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you\'re reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it . \nto be fair , i must admit that i\'ve never been very fond of "" period-piece "" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past . \nperhaps it\'s because most of those i\'ve seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it\'s because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant . \nin fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end . \nor , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts . \nhaving said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i\'ve seen , and i quite enjoyed it . \nsurprised ? \nwell , so was i . \ndrunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu . \nwhere he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong\'s practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu . \napparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i\'ve heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i\'ll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better . \none of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the "" once upon a time in china "" movies , but i have not yet seen those . \nthe plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you\'re watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren\'t expecting something on the order of "" war and peace "" . \nthe story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china\'s cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill . \nhowever , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong\'s perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs . \nthe macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners . \nin the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer . \nin the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng . \nafter fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners\' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general\'s son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng . \nand so it goes . \nand the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong\'s girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i\'ve already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves . \nlet\'s move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the \naction . \nthere\'s plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of \ncourse , in a kung fu film , that\'s to be expected . \nhowever , this isn\'t just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius . \nthe primary martial arts "" style "" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk . \nfurther , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but \nthere\'s a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor . \nunder normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair . \nthe kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i\'ll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching . \nanother thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work . \neven without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film . \namong other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . \n ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) \nunlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . \ndrunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( "" a better tomorrow "" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the "" heroic trio "" series , "" rumble in the bronx "" ) . \nthe performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . \nthe scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong\'s father\'s back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong\'s mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband\'s anger away from fei-hong ) . \njackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he\'s in fine form all through drunken master ii . \nas far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . \nit\'s nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . \nthe picture is crisp and clear . \none thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i\'ve ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . \n ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) \nit will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release . \ndrunken master ii shows the full potential of "" period piece "" kung fu movies , and it\'s good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies . \nthe plot does meander a bit , but that\'s to be expected in this type of film . \nif you like this kind of movie , you\'ll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway . \nif nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental . \n'"
0,"b'a few months before the release of star wars episode 1 , the phantom menace , 20th century fox decides to release another space film , that is a complete rip off of star wars . \nwhat is the point of this ? \ni do not know , but i wish it hadn\'t been done , considering wing commander is definitely the year\'s worst film so far . \nto attract people to this horrible movie , they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace . \nwing commander will draw large crowds , because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time . \nthe trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight . \nmany people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game . \ni found this very interesting , considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie . \nit is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though . \nfreddie prinze jr . stars in the film as christopher blair . \nwing commander was a huge mistake for freddie . \nthis was definitely his worst performance to date . \nafter january\'s she\'s all that , i actually saw a good actor in freddie , but now all those visions have been crushed . \n ( for now anyway . ) \nchristopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi , a group that is trying to destroy the earth . \nblair\'s parents also fought in the space battles , and also died there . \nhis parents were pilgrims , so many people disrespect him because of this . \nblair is under the command of "" angel "" , played by saffron burrows , and he is friends with another pilot , todd "" maniac marshall "" , played by matthew lillard . \nmatthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie , and he does in this one too . \nhis character as stu in 1996\'s scream ( a+ ) , was a great one , but now , it seems like that same role is being played again , only in a space movie . \nthe three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth . \nthis plot is very flimsy , and doesn\'t give a whole lot to work with at all . \nthis explains why wing commander drags on , seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on . \nthe acting is horrible in wing commander . \nmany lines seem out of place , and are completely meaningless . \nthe acting and dialogue was so terrible , i even found myself laughing at it . \nthe other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music . \nthe special effects are very unrealistic . \nwhen looking at two ships flying side by side , it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them . \nthe explosions look very unrealistic as well . \na ship will be blown up , but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second . \nthis is very unrealistic . \nmusic pretty much accompanies the film the entire time . \nthe music also felt like video game music , and it was very corny and annoying sounding . \nafter we are given the plot , the film repeats itself for another hour , without any plot twists , interesting scenes , or anything important to the film . \nblair is forced to make jumps over other planets , and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft . \nfor the entire length of the movie , it takes place in space . \nit is truly like you are in a video game , because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long , extended period of time . \nit\'s not much fun to watch at all . \nif i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships , i would go watch star wars at home . \nat least star wars pays attention to people , myth , feelings , and has some real plot to it . \nthe bottom line- bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox ! \n'"
0,"b""this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset : the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st . \nelsewhere for several years , and i had understood that the director/screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also . \ni am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations , nor were they satisfactory . \nif i had to list a reason why . . . . \nbut that would be getting ahead of myself ; besides , it's not immediately clear , as there are so many problems with the film . \nadam arkin plays a grade-school teacher who is sardonic , cynical , and somewhat abrasive , but a good teacher . \nhe spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court . \none day , he meets a drifter ( david morse , who plays jack morrison on st . \nelsewhere ) in the park , and inveigles him in a game of one-on-one basketball . \nmorse turns out to be good , and a friendship slowly develops between the two , as their respective professions progress on the screen--arkin's teaching , and morse's selling of paper flowers to passing motorists . \nso far , my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue , and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack . \ngood music to be sure , but it doesn't replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story--it makes the film somewhat minimalistic , a technique i rarely admire . \nsuddenly their friendship is interrupted by morse's introduction to a fellow teacher of arkin's , a woman arkin has long admired from afar , but it too reticent to approach . \nit appears that she begins to admire morse ( who enjoys here attentions , but isn't sure what to do about it--she doesn't realize that he is a drifter , and knows nothing about his past ) , and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else . \nuntil then , i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film . \nthe conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full-fledged failure . \nthe woman , at least to me , appeared to be fairly shallow ; i didn't realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin , where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse . \nsomehow , this is made to appear as if it is arkin's fault , and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that he's gotten such a find of girlfriend . \nfrankly , dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make ; punching her in the mouth not the least . \nafter this , the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural . \nif i had to summarize a major gripe , it's that this is a story spread too thin , that creates semi-likable characters at the outset , and then suddenly jerks them into being 16-year-olds at the last moment . \nit might be true-to-life with some people ; but that doesn't mean * i * have to like it . \ni don't . \n . \navoid . \n"""
1,"b""saving private ryan ( dreamworks ) running time : 2 hours 48 minutes . \nstarring tom hanks , edward burns , tom sizemore and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the 'greatest war movie ever made , ' saving private ryan is an harrowing , saddening and riveting movie . \nit may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion , but it's certainly one of the best war movies made , and one of the best of 1998 . \ntom hanks stars as a captain who's troop has to find private ryan ( damon ) who has a ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action . \naction , drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him . \nafter the disappointing amistad ( 1997 ) spielberg has returned to form with this excellent movie . \ni'm not the war movie genre biggest fan , but i found this film to be gripping , and very scary , thanks to the excellent cast , direction and terrifying battle scenes . \ntom hanks is superb , straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles , such as in forrest gump ( 1994 ) . \nthis time , he plays the role with gritty realism , and is much better for it . \noccasionally he overacts the sentimentally , but he generally delivers a fine performance . \nedward burns , looking a lot like armageddon's ben affleck , also delivers a top notch performance , moving away from his roles in films such as she's the one ( 1996 ) tom sizemore makes less of an impact , but is still watchable , and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today . \nspielberg directs very well , putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes . \nand what battle scenes they are ! \nthey're truly terrifying , yet the audience cannot drag their eyes away from the screen . \nthe battle scenes are filmed with a jerky hand-held camera , and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique . \nthe gore and violence isn't spared either , which body parts flying , and blood spurting . \nthis film is certainly not for kids and sensitive adults . \nother factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90's film making . \nthe cinematography is excellent , and the music score by john william's is also superb . \nit is never intrusive , and adds to the drama on-screen . \nbut while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan , there's one major flaw that detracts the genius of the film : the writing . \nit is unusually flat , with many of the speeches strangely weak . \nthe film never really makes any profound statements . \nthis is not a major gripe , as private ryan is a film of action , not words . \nstill , the script could of been a lot better . \nthankfully , the actors help partly to rectify the situation with their great delivery of their lines . \nsaving private ryan , in the end , is an excellent film , but not the 'greatest war movie' due to it's weak acting . \nthis film should be viewed by everyone who has the stomach for it , as it's rewarding and extremely worthwhile . \nit really shouldn't be missed , and dreamworks skg has finally found it's first hit movie . \n"""

1,"b'it\'s terribly unfortunate that "" stir of echoes , "" tautly written and directed by david koepp ( who made one of 1996\'s unsung treasures , "" the trigger effect "" ) , should be released little more than a month after "" the sixth sense , "" which is still going strong at the box office . \nthese two films are undoubtedly going to be compared ( judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night ) , and although they have eerily similar storylines , "" stir of echoes "" is more of a straightforward psychological horror film , while "" the sixth sense "" is closer to a psychological drama . \nadditionally , while "" the sixth sense "" had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business , "" stir of echoes "" is more conventional and predictable in its final twist . \nand where "" the sixth sense "" was disturbing , "" stir of echoes "" is just plain scary . \ni have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities , and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits . \nadapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago , "" stir of echoes "" opens with a cute six-year-old boy named jake ( zachary david cope ) who is taking a bath . \nhe is speaking directly at the screen , but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there . \nfinally , he asks , "" does it hurt to be dead ? "" \napparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people , but unlike "" the sixth sense , "" this young child isn\'t the focus of the picture . \ninstead , tom witzy ( kevin bacon ) , a chicago lineman , is our protagonist . \njake is his son , and maggie ( kathryn erbe ) , whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant , is his hard-working wife . \none night while at a party with their closest friends , tom convinces maggie\'s new-age sister , lisa ( illena douglas ) , to try and hypnotize him . \nit unexpectedly works , and before long , tom is seeing things he wouldn\'t normally see , including a deceased teenage girl ( jenny morrison ) in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months . \nseeking help from lisa , she tells him that , while he was under hypnosis , she told him that after he awoke , his mind will remain clear and free , like an opened door . \nshe didn\'t expect it to work , but it did , and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees . \n "" stir of echoes "" isn\'t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the thick , atmospheric mood it conjures up , it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror-drama , and is not only effective on a technical level , but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working-class family . \nkevin bacon and , especially , kathryn erbe ( 1997\'s "" dream with the fishes "" ) , are top-notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems . \nafter tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions , he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house , and instead of maggie not being understanding , she instead believes what tom says , and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through , does not try to stop his pursuit . \nbacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts , and therefore , are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet . \nin a masterfully-done , entrancing sequence , tom is hypnotized by lisa , but instead of watching him , we instead see what he sees , starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness . \nlisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater , and so , we , as audience members , are watching a movie screen from inside a theater , which is also showing a movie screen in a theater . \ntelling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen , we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is "" sleep . "" \nnever before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly-construed as this one . \ntruthfully , this set-piece , and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt , are worth the full price of admission alone , just to see them on the big screen . \nhaving loads of fun with her small role as maggie\'s sister , lisa , illeana douglas ( 1995\'s "" to die for , "" her last great character ) is a delight , but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films . \nfunny and enjoyably offbeat , douglas gets to utter the best line in the film : while talking to maggie about tom\'s visions of the girl , she remarks , "" i wouldn\'t be worried about him seeing another girl , although the fact that she\'s dead gives one pause . "" \nalso of note are jenny morrison ( 1994\'s "" intersection "" ) , who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character , and liza weil , remarkable in 1998\'s "" whatever , "" as morrison\'s grieving teenage sister , debbie . \nif the resolution of "" stir of echoes "" does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential ( and it doesn\'t ) , what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty . \nthe music score , by james newton howard , and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects , successfully compliment and foreshadow the off-kilter frame-of-mind that tom is put into , and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically-written characters . \n "" stir of echoes "" isn\'t as good as "" the sixth sense , "" but why should it need to be ? \nboth films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet , and "" stir of echoes "" really is a spinetinglingly good horror film . \n'"

1,"b'ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances . \nfor his followup to the academy-beloved the english patient , he has once again turned to a love story , this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong ( little women ) . \ndespite some obvious overplotting , oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences . \nthe film opens in the mid-1800s , with parallel storylines in new south wales , australia and devon , england . \nas the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us , lucinda leplastrier ( cate blanchett ) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback . \nmeanwhile , half the world away , oscar hopkins ( fiennes ) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues , and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest . \nlucinda is fascinated with glass ; oscar is obsessed with theology . \nlucinda is rich ; oscar is poor . \nlucinda is forward and self-assured ; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself . \nyet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it\'s on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin . \nand fate has decreed that they will one day meet . \nthat day doesn\'t occur until 45 minutes into the film , when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney , australia , where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help . \nanother of the passengers is lucinda , who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly-acquired glassworks factory . \nat first , their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor , but it doesn\'t take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other . \na friendship is born , and , once they reach australia , it develops into something more potent . \nbut oscar is uncertain of lucinda\'s affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her . \noscar and lucinda isn\'t beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions . \non more than one occasion , it\'s apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route . \ncoincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can\'t go anywhere . \nthe voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments . \n ( however , without it , the final twist , which i will not reveal , would not be as poignant . ) \nyet , despite these quibbles , i enjoyed oscar and lucinda . \nstoryline faults pale in the light of two such finely-realized characters . \nthematically , the film is also strong . \nthe unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated . \noscar and lucinda don\'t just wager their money , they bet their hearts , minds , and souls . \na card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional "" strip poker "" where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared , secret passion . \noscar does not see gambling as a vice . \nin fact , he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one\'s immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith . \nralph fiennes , who normally plays strong , confident men , is very much at home as the fumbling , insecure oscar . \nthe actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part , all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on-screen . \nas good as fiennes is , however , he is eclipsed by cate blanchett . \nthe actress , who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresford\'s paradise road , is mesmerizing as lucinda . \nshe gives this liberated woman her flash , and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles . \neffective support is provided by ciaran hinds ( the male lead in jane austen\'s persuasion ) as lucinda\'s close friend , tom wilkinson ( the full monty ) as oscar\'s mentor , and clive russell as a self-serving adventurer . \nthere\'s a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story , keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence . \n ( in fact , i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act , which has oscar and lucinda together . ) \nwith the skill of a consummate storyteller , she weaves romance , friendship , passion , humor , and tragedy together into a complete package . \nthe characters , with all of their human foibles and neuroses , are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett . \nso who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy ? \noscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer . \n'"

1,"b""review : a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders . \nliving with his grandfather jehan ( jack warden ) in poverty , nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times ( they are renting a spare one-room cottage , and the greedy , malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them `out of the house' if they don't pay the rent ) . \nnello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen , in either a movie or in real life . \n ( his hero is peter paul rubens , the great flemish painter of the 17th century . ) \nnot that these are the only things that make nello's life happy , however . \nhe has a dog of flanders , whom he names patrasche , who is a heroic rin-tin-tin of the 19th century , whom he rescues from his cruel , unkind master . \nin addition , he even has a best friend ( and future sweetheart ) in the lovely , wealthy aloise , whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with `lower-class' nello . \n ( he thinks he's not good enough for her , and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying . ) \nbut then , he was a poor guy himself before he married ( as mentioned later on in the film ) . \none day , nello encounters a mysterious , yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande ( played wonderfully by jon voight ) , who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart , and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist . \nand every christmas , there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year ; the winner getting a lot of money . \neager to save his home ( and his aging , dying grandfather ) , nello willingly decides to become an artist , asking aloise to pose for him . \none night , the two travel to a circus , where they have their fortune told ? one of the film's most delightful scenes ? that great happiness is destined for them . \nshe gives the kids a ring , whom nello places on aloise's hand . \n ; ) afterwards , the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers . \nunfortunately , things are not all `la-dee-dah' in this tale . \naloise's father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again . \nbad enough that they can't see each other ( although we know nello and aloise , don't we ? ) , but that's only the start of nello's troubles . \naloise's farm is burned down , and nello is wrongfully accused ( by the landord of his cottage ) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise . \nthis decreases nello's reputation around the town , save aloise and her parents , and a kindly miller , william , who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by . \nmatters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies , and he has to pay for his funeral . \nbut then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home ( for not paying his rental ) ? permanetly . \nthis means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold , freezing wind . \nworst of all , the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time , `the portrait of the princess' , fails to win the prize at the festival . \nnow nello and patrasche are really depressed , and close to freezing to death . \nwill nello be able to find any happiness in his life ? \nwill patrasche save the day ? \nwill nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise ? \na dog of flanders is a delightful , heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages . \neven older ones who consider themselves too `sophisticated' for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown-ups , too . \nthere have been other movies of this ilk ( boy and dog ) , and while this one falls into that category , it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself . \nmove over ? or rather , roll over ? old yeller , this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight . \nthe cinematography , courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful , and really adds to the powerful drama of the film . \nit also gives a feel of being in flanders ( the whole film was respectably shot in flanders ) . \nthe music from richard friedman is also remarkable ; an evocative , poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century . \nthe opening song over the credits is very beautiful ( i hope the soundtrack is available ! ) , and there's a brief excerpt of `cheer up , charlie' from willy wonka and the chocolate factory ( sung by aloise , to nello , in another delightful scene ) . \nthe cast is first-rate : jesse james and jeremy james kissner , who play nello , are some of the most endearing , adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life ( so are the girls who play aloise , madyline sweeten as the younger , and farren monet as the older ) . \nnot that they are the only good stars , however . \njack warden is ideal as jehan , eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character . \n ( the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming , touching ones . ) \nalso , bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william . \nhe's another one of my favorite characters in the film . \nbut jon voight , as i mentioned before , is the perfect choice for michel . \nhe brings a mysterious , yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he * can * win the contest . \nbut what makes this film fun to watch is how well-defined the characters are , and the pace of the story ( best of all , it has a happy ending ? though i will * not * give it away ; sorry ) is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters . \nfor the first time since the beginning of 1999 , there comes a film which doesn't rely on popular formula stuff , such as big-budget special effects , commercial rock soundtracks , or any of that stuff . \nthis one relies on telling a fully character-oriented story , with just the right amount of heart , humor , and drama . \nthat , to me , is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful . \neleanor o'sullivan of `the home news & tribune' noticed this , and was kind and generous enough to welcome it : `for want of a better word , a glow surrounds a dog of flanders . \nits heart is in the right place and it engages you . \nyou can guess where the film is going because this is well-traveled territory , but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner , an often-told story is well worth a revisit . ' \nin addition , there were a couple of other enthusiasts , such as chicago-sun times and the washington post ( you should read their reviews ; they're really positive ) . \nother critics , however , were not so kind . \nstephen holden of `the new york times' had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing . \nhe found the film to be a `sea of sugary bromides' and condemned mr . voight's character as `hopelessly wooden ? adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda . ' \nin addition , `entertainment weekly' slam-dunked the film , condemning it as `the worst family film of the year . ' \nthere have been so many other bad reviews like this , too . \nmy suggestion : disregard the critics . \nthey just have a big problem with touching family films , and one should never pay attention to them . \nthis dog of flanders may only be a little `family' movie ( it probably won't be a big hit in the style of titanic , but then again no other film has been since then ) , but that is not a bad thing in and of itself . \nthis is a story that is sure to warm your heart , and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders . \nit is also one of the better family films around this year . \nnone of the other films i have seen this year ( though they were good ) have been so low-key and touching . \nif you're looking for family-style entertainment , look no further than this charming boy-and-dog yarn . \ngo see it while you still can , for as i mentioned , it might not be a big bow-wow at the box office for a long time . \nsee it while you can . \nthere is really no need to compare a multi-million dollar blockbuster such as star wars : episode i ? the phantom menace or tarzan , or even the iron giant with a tender , sweet little family movie . \n"""
1,"b'with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous "" ellen "" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines . \nthe birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy . \nthen along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released . \nit\'s also noticeable that this "" alternative lifestyle "" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort . \nwhile it\'s a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety . \nbut the way we\'re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically . \nwhile the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy . \nit doesn\'t poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it\'s comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been . \nthe idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia . \nif you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life . \nit\'s a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick . \nit\'s true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set . \nkevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana . \nafter a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar . \nthe small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other . \nwhen cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett . \neveryone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , "" and he\'s gay . "" \nthe town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop . \nthe thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf . \nnaturally the questions pour from howard\'s fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school\'s principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand . \nthe frenzy isn\'t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and "" entertainment tonight "" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning . \none particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of "" inside entertainment "" , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding . \nthe intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute . \nit seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees . \nthe dominoes begin to tumble as howard\'s closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay . \nit all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren\'t presented with near-perfection by one of this year\'s most delightful ensemble casts . \nkline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here . \nthe great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully . \nevery single actor turns in one of their best performances ever . \ndillon has never been so likeable , cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart all provide huge laughs when they\'re up to bat . \nrudnick\'s script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you\'ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes . \nwhile in & out doesn\'t carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all-around . \nthe script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top- notch , and we\'re allowed just the perfect blend of heart-tugging so as not to bog down the laughs . \nit remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we\'re still allowed a sappily touching ending . \ndespite it\'s subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy . \nfrank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , directs this film quite delightfully , using all the potential rudnick\'s script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit . \ncheck this one out . \nyou\'ll have a gay old time . \n'"

"" \nthe ending is some kind of big tragedy thing , but come on . \nlike we care about any of the characters . \nthe only interesting one is alicia , mainly because she\'s alicia , and we mostly see her in the fantasies . \nso i guess she\'s some kind of mystery or something . \nbut she is never explored further . \nso , basically , this film is just a series of mastabatory images , sometimes featuring a non-nude alicia ( once again , sadly ) , sometimes featuring a scantily-clad george segal ( once again , sadly ) . \ni watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night , and let me tell you , it is the only way to watch this film . \ni mean , there\'s a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night : they\'re just as good as sleeping pills . \nand this one is one big fat waste of time , even for an alicia film . \n'"
1,"b""cinema has been around for about a hundred years now . ? \nit's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time . \nrecently , i've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others . \n ? those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius . ? \nthey are likely to be remembered for . \n . \n . \nwell , quite a while . ? \ni like this film , too . ? \nyes , it's a disaster-slash-action movie . ? \ntrue , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime . ? \nand there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money . ? \nin fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable . \ni certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through . \nof course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together . \nthe story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters . \nyes , you read that right . \narmageddon actually has characters you can care about ! \nif you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be . \nif you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story . \nit turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film . \nso , it's up to the u . s . government to stop it . \n ( why the u . s . is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated . ) \ntheir plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within . \nthe head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis ) . \nhis group of men is a colorful bunch , including a . j . \n ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) . \nthere's also an interesting triangle formed between a . j . , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry's daughter . \na . j . \nand grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad isn't too happy with the situation . \nit's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you'd like to call armageddon . \nit's not about story -- it's about viscera and action , and thrills-a-minute , and all that stuff . \nit's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds' thought to what actually happens . \nbut bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better . \ni think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles . \ntake the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york . \na meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars . \nthe action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways . \ni like his quick-edit style , because it's abrasive and exhausting to watch . \nit's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times . \nbut it's fun to be obnoxious sometimes . \nthe special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame . \ndeep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable . \nspecial effects are very important in a film like this : if they're not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film doesn't work . \neverything here looks bright and explosive -- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid . \nthe effects that don't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice-looking that it actually qualifies as art . \nof course , all of this would add up to little more than an above-average light show , if i didn't get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action . \nthe film is two and a half hours long , and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action . \nmuch of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters' subplots . \ni won't suggest that these are complex characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions aren't put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way . \nin fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel-good parts of its story . \nbruce willis is terrific , and i'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) . \ntyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level . \npatton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here , and the minor subplot revolving around his ex-wife and son is very moving . \nthe comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny . \ni wasn't challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i don't mind too much . \nbut the film doesn't insult my intelligence -- it's pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do . \nit's not mindless and escapist , but well-crafted cinema . \nit might have been created for the wrong reasons , but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good , in spite of the producers and the budget . \ni'm not saying that films like this are risky moves . \nwhat i am saying is that armageddon is a big , loud , expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms . \n"""
1,"b'the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year . \nwe are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office . \nthis year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy . \ni have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them . \nthat tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza . \nin the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o\'connell . \nhe teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra . \nevelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable . \nrick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that\'s why she chose him to lead her there . \nalso tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn\'s brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors ) . \nnow in hamunaptra , the three uncover "" the book of the dead . "" \nthe curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book . \nalong with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra . \nnot only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt . \ndon\'t expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time . \nthis movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers . \non the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that\'s up to you to decide . \nthere is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though . \nthe state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world . \nwe are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human\'s skin . \nthese may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy . \nas of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country . \nin the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles . \nwhen playing "" george "" in disney\'s george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone . \ni would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens . \nin the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle . \nalthough brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast . \nweisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film . \nthe way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time . \nevelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah\'s , didn\'t get much personal attention . \nin many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part . \nin the mummy though , not all of the mixing works . \nthere are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work . \nthe mummy could have gotten an "" a "" rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these . \ni didn\'t mind the corny one-liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them . \nthe cinematography is amazing in the mummy . \nparticularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians . \nthe costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography . \nfrom ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch . \nthe bottom line- with the mummy , the summer is off to its usually great start . \n'"
1,"b'in "" the sweet hereafter , "" writer/director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living . \nhe shows us how it isn\'t dying that hurts , but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death , and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings . \non a cold winter day in a small , isolated town in british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks . \nfourteen children die , and numerous others are hurt . \nfor the residents of this small town , all of whose children were on that bus , it is an earth-shattering event that resolutely alters their lives . \nthey have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle . \nalberta and risa walker , who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident , hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ( ian holm ) to bring a lawsuit against someone , anyone for responsibility . \nthe bus driver , dolores driscoll ( gabrielle rose ) , is a kindly woman who loved the children and , although she lives with a burden of guilt , is not held responsible for the accident . \nthe bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice , and there was nothing should could do to prevent it . \nhowever , according to stephens , there are no "" accidents "" in life , and someone will pay for this tragedy , whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through . \nhe goes through the town , approaching the parents who have lost children , asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger . \nand , for his work , stephens will receive one-third of the settlement money . \nhowever , it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money . \nhe is driven by something else , something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents . \nhe has lost a child , too , but not in the same manner . \nhis daughter , zoe ( caerthan banks ) , who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite , has been in and out of drug re-hab clinics and detox stations for ten years . \nshe calls him on an irregular basis , begging him for money , but refusing to tell him what she needs it for . \n "" i don\'t know who i\'m taking to , "" he tells her . \nin his mind , his daughter is dead . \nthe lawsuit is , to stephens , not only a way to mend the town\'s pain , but also his own . \nhowever , not everyone in town wants it to happen . \nbilly ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children , wants nothing to do with it . \nhe has already lost his wife , and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman . \nhe doesn\'t want to talk about the accident , and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds . \nto him , the town should be able to take care of its own pain , and it doesn\'t need outsiders like stephens getting in the way . \ncentral to "" the sweet hereafter "" is the tale of nicole burnell ( sarah polley ) , a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into "" a wheelchair girl , "" as she puts it . \naside from stephens , nicole is the most complex character in the film , and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out . \nit is also her sad , haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack , reading robert browning\'s poem about the pied piper , and how when he led all the town\'s children away , one was left behind because he was crippled . \nobviously , nicole is that child , and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town\'s children left her alone by dying in the wreck . \nher situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving , but incestuous relationship with her father ( tom mccamus ) . \nthere is only one , fleeting scene that suggests this relationship , but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film . \nof all the storylines in "" the sweet hereafter , "" this is the most complicated and unresolved , although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film . \negoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers -- if any at all -- and he doesn\'t condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up . \nwhat egoyan has done in "" the sweet hereafter "" is really nothing short of miraculous . \nin his adaptation of the novel by russell banks , he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss , and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life . \negoyan has always been a talented , but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold . \n "" the sweet hereafter "" is quite the opposite ; egoyan\'s stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion , and draw the audience into the tragedy . \n "" the sweet hereafter "" seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked . \nthe film is filled with beautiful , subtle performances from all the actors , especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind . \nthe beautiful , roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting , melodic musical score by mychael danna ( both previous egoyan collaborators ) give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements . \nlike his earlier films , egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole . \nhe works with time as a fluid substance , shifting back and forth between the past , the distant past , and the present with effortless ease . \nthe actual bus wreck itself doesn\'t happen until midway through the film , but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail , and still have it carry great , devastating weight . \nbecause human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies , it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple , direct terms . \ncertainly one of the best films of 1997 , "" the sweet hereafter "" is a deeply rewarding , mystifying , and ultimately human film . \n'"
0,"b'my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one , but in fact the third installment ( it was the first to gain a national theatrical release ) . \ni didn\'t see the first film until much later . \nso looking back , the original didn\'t hold a lot of great memories for me , since i didn\'t think too much of it when i initially saw it . \nwatching it now for a second time confirmed that it\'s an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever . \nyou all know the story by now : child murderer freddy krueger ( robert englund ) returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before . \nthis first installment does an adequate job with it\'s low budget , but there\'s some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story . \nplus the movie\'s ending ( understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a "" hook "" for a sequel ) renders the rest of the film pointless . \nand does anyone understand what happens to nancy\'s mother at the end of this film ? \ndon\'t get me wrong though . . . \nit\'s not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics . \nmost horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is . \nhorror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly , and a nightmare on elm street just doesn\'t cut it . \na nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video . \nit is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set . \nthe film is presented in both pan and scan and it\'s original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 78 : 1 ( although on the disc that comes in the box set , only a widescreen transfer is provided ) . \nthe film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio : a mono mix and a new dolby digital 5 . 1 mix . \nalso included on the dvd is a full-length audio commentary track with writer/director wes craven , stars john saxon and heather langenkamp , and the film\'s director of photography . \nother extras include the "" jump to a nightmare "" feature ( i\'m sure you can figure that one out ) , the usual cast and crew bios ( which are from the film\'s original press release kit , and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp ! ) , and the film\'s original theatrical trailer . \nsome dvd-rom features are also included , but since i don\'t have dvd-rom capabilities i can\'t really get into that . \nthe commentary track is entertaining and informative , but nothing spectacular . \nthe first thing of note is that it\'s the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago . \ni\'m not saying that\'s a negative thing , just pointing it out . \neveryone seems enthusiastic about being there , with the possible exception of john saxon , who just doesn\'t say much at all . \nmost of the time you\'ll forget he\'s even there . \neveryone else talks really quietly though for some reason , as if because they\'re commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible . \nthe bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series . \nalso included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film . . . \nhowever you can only access one easily . \nthe other is hidden in what\'s called "" the labyrinth "" , which might possibly be the most annoying feature of a dvd ever created . \nbasically , it\'s an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage , interviews , etc . somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film . \nfinding it though is both a chore and a bore . \n[r] \n'"
0,"b""this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash . \nthis is more about a parable of greed , and how money can become the bane of your life . \nyes , there are elements of ? fargo' here ( the snow and cold ) , although not as vivid in the blood and gore department . \nit shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives . \nand how at the end of the day , the things that matter most are love , truth and honesty . \nalthough in one sense it may seem tedious , making a movie about the ugliness of greed ( not box office material ) , it does become tedious , not because of the morale ending , but because one expects the movie to end that way . \nthis becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime , the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there . \nthe characters in this drama are a mixture of simple and intellectual folk , brothers and friends , who all fall prey to the avarice of money . \nthey should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible , level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance . \ncommendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton , whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful . \nbill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother , whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife , who indirectly causes the most problems . \nfill a room full of greedy people and several million dollars , and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath . \nit's not a simple plan , when you shoot everyone you love for money , unless you're the menendez brothers . \n"""
1,"b' "" you\'ll go ape over tarzan because it\'s more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! "" \nokay , there\'s the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie . \ndisney\'s latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship . \nfather , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson . \nit\'s amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack . \nbefore you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard . \nagainst the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own . \ntarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild . \nmuch of tarzan\'s young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his "" father , "" which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts . \nall he\'s looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults . \nwhen you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end . \nlook back on past disney animated features and you\'ll see the trend . \ngrowing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends . \none is an ape named terk ( rosie o\'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight ) . \nboth provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold . \ni\'m beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films . \njust fill in the blanks ! \ncan you see it ? \n "" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it . \nwe\'ve already had a fish and a crab , and we\'ve had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues . . . . have \nwe had an ape and an elephant yet ? \nwell , there we go ! "" \nof course , there\'s gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through . \ntogether with her father dr . porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa . \nshe discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory "" you tarzan , me jane "" scene . \nthankfully , those aren\'t the exact words . \nhowever , i found it distracting that tarzan is going "" ohh ohh ee ee "" one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction . \nhow does he tell his name to another ape ? \n "" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? "" \nwell , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable . \nbut hey , tarzan\'s a young adult . \ndo you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? \nisn\'t that illegal in most countries ? \noh , well . \ni don\'t think disney will be using my quote anymore . \ntarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical . \nthere\'s lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time . \nwe instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material . \nthis isn\'t really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it\'s just different . \ndo yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie . \nwith each new feature , disney animation gets even better . \nnot necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan . \nthere are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying . \nthe way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn\'t just tarzan , it\'s "" extreme tarzan . "" \nhowever , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its "" chandelier scene , "" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking . \nlasting but a few seconds at most , it\'s been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail . \nas usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters . \nthe one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o\'donnell . \ngoing into the film , i didn\'t know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately . \nher performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , "" that\'s no boy ape , that rosie o\'donnell .

0,"b'are you like me ? \ndo you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places , shouting out loud , not giving a ratt\'s ass about anyone around them , and basically just wallowing in their own self-importance ? \nwell if you are , than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour and a half . . . only to make up and hug in the end . \naaaaaaaahhhh . . . \nplot : three grown-up sisters living their own separate lives , begin to re-establish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill . \ncritique : this would be a good movie if it wasn\'t for the fact that it\'s got very little to say , features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations , is chockfull of bad acting moments and provides less emotional satisfaction than any third-rate after-school special . \nand i\'m being nice ! \nhow junk like this gets made is beyond me , but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt a professional blow , considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit . \nthe only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryan\'s character and her dad in this film is when he hugs her and swings her around at a christmas tree lot . \nwow . . . how \ndeep . \nof course , the same christmas tune that\'s played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background , while characters continue to build "" bonds "" among one another by making reference to old , quaint movies or movie stars . \nstop me . . . i\'m \ngonna cry again ! \nthis film is a mess . \nthe characters are boring and irritating to watch , the plot has something to do with three selfish sisters talking on the phone a whole lot , kind of liking their father ( but not really ) and then finally realizing the error of their ways , while sharing an "" emotional "" moment about movie stars from the 50s . \nadmittedly , i was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds and a big dog rolling its eyes , but even i was surprised at the level of ineptitude when it came to some of the acting efforts put forth in this film . \nmeg did fine as the sister who cries a lot , looking as adorable as ever , but someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent home of limited range , cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movie/tv show that she\'s in . \nenough already ! \nand diane keaton must\'ve spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one , cause her acting was amateurish at best . \nneither one convinced in "" emotional "" scenes . \ngranted , they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film and that\'s probably where my rating of three points comes from . \nall in all , this movie is not funny ( unless you\'re one to chuckle at train wrecks ) , provides zero drama ( unless you consider loud phone conversations moving ) , generates absolutely no emotion ( although i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine ) and ends on a perfectly pretentious note ( "" oh no , please don\'t get any flour on my donna karan dress ! ) . \nugh . \ni suggest that all ladies take their husbands/boyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something ! \nthat\'ll teach \'em to mess with you ! \noh and incidentally , mrs . joblo also likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing in the wind , so there ! \nthen again . . . maybe \nyou\'ll like it . \n : ) \n'"
1,"b'when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences . \nthe first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . \nthe latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . \ndecades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . \nyes , most of the kung fu and other "" martial arts "" flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . \nbut , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . \nthe best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . \nmade in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee\'s skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . \nit succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . \nlee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . \nhe is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . \ninterpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . \nlee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o\'harra , han\'s brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee\'s sister years ago . \nthe island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . \nthe plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . \nthe main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . \non the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . \nin the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy . \nthe latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee\'s acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . \nalthough two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . \nit is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . \nother actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . \nfighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . \nin many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . \ni\'m not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can\'t avoid to appreciate the difference from today\'s movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . \nso , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don\'t like that particular genre . \n'"

1,"b'bob the happy bastard\'s quickie review : \nthe mummy \nbrendan fraser\'s stuck in the past again , but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone . . . \nfraser is the lead star of the mummy , the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising ) . \nit\'s a rough adaptation of the 1932 film , and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages , like boris karloff was engulfed in . \nbut who cares , the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can\'t get from , oh , say , godzilla or armageddon . \nfraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground . \nbasically , it\'s a little sign from the mummy buried underneath- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress . \nhis plan- wake back up and wake her up also , making him invincible . \nof course , fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian ( rachel weisz ) and her brother ( john hanna ) , along with a former buddy of his ( deep rising\'s kevin j . o\'connor ) and some "" americans "" . . . and \nguess what ? \nyup , ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awakens and wreaks havoc . \nfire flies from the sky , flesh-eating beetles crawl about , and , well , ihmoetep\'s plan begins to unfold . \nok , so it\'s not really all that new a story , but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough . \nthe special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch , and the acting from fraser and weisz isn\'t half bad either . \nthe action is pretty intense ( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror-loving folks as well . \nno , it\'s no phantom menace beater , but if you\'re looking for a solid warm-up to the summer movie season , you won\'t find a better film under wraps than the mummy . \nif this doesn\'t give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man , then nothing will . \n'"
1,"b""once again , the battle is dreamworks versus disney : earlier this year , the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end-of-the-world asteroid flicks , deep impact and armageddon . \nhere we are now , just a few months later , and they're at it again with dueling bug movies , antz and a bug's life . \nwhat i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution . \ni mean , come on -- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer-animated films about bugs ? \nas was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug's life is far superior . \nin fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug's life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything . \nbut it's not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison . \na bug's life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer-animated film about bugs . \nin fact , it's one of the best films this year : it's smart , subtle , and funny , but it's also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining . \ni haven't had such a good time at the movies in months . \nit tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he's a nice guy , but he's also a troublemaker . \nthe ants spend all season putting together the offering , a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers . \njust before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper's leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they're all dead . \nflick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them . \nhe heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde-pierce , also giving a hilarious performance ) . \nflick doesn't know they're actors , and they don't know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position . \nthe most obvious element of a bug's life is the quality of animation . \ncreated by pixar , the same people who brought us toy story , a bug's life has some of the most amazing visuals i've ever seen . \nthe bugs seem to inhabit a three-dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action . \nthis is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc . ) and make them active objects in the bugs' world is innovative . \nthe film is also mercilessly exciting , particularly in a superbly-staged scene involving our heroes' escape from a bird ( a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening ) . \nbut the makers of a bug's life know where the importance lies : story and characters . \nflick , with solid voice work from foley , is a great guy to lead the story . \nbut the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they're such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde-pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar . \nall of these bugs have more than a token personality , which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs , and it also keeps the tear-jerking scenes from seeming obligatory . \nin my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop-out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant-like existence . \nin concept , a bug's life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn't like about it . \nwith such strong work in both animation and script , a bug's life is nothing but a joy to sit through . \nit really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie , but a bug's life is so good that i'm sure it will find its audience . \nafter a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies , it's downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty . \n"""
1,"b""the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats . \nit's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea . \nsometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other . \nquality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem . \nbut too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors . \nflying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists . \nmostly it's laughable . \nin hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form . \nbut iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right . \niron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry . \nbut it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) . \nunlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression . \niron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth . \niron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger . \nhowever , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox . \nin those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience . \nwhile in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune . \naka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau . \n"""
1,"b""i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years . \nit was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood . \nbut of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex . \nyes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster . \nfor all teenagers , it's almost like a rite of passage . \nand what we did was sometimes downright nasty , sometimes funny , and sometimes shocking . \nand all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer . \n`american pie' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year . \njust how great are their hormones raging ? \none of them notes , after watching disney's the little mermaid , that ariel is soooo hot . \nthe four schoolmates are kevin , oz , finch and jim . \nkevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend , but doesn't want to have sex until the time is just right . \nbut what is the perfect time ? \nthere is just no way to know , and that frightens him . \noz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive . \nhe joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages . \nfinch is the phobic hermit who doesn't stand a chance with any girl . \nso , he pays someone $200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess . \nsuddenly , girls are lining up to go out with him . \nbut among these friends , it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful . \nwhen he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student , his inexperience comes shining through . \nhe has much to learn , and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge . \nthis may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom's apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking , raunchy , yet unbelievably funny . \nthe one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r' rating . \nthere is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that `there's something about mary' was gloriously ribald . \nin fact , at first this film received a sinful nc-17 rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teen-accessible rating . \nbut i guess after seeing the no-holds-barred coarseness of south park , this seems tame by comparison . \nteens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest . \nbut unlike many teen sex comedies , there is a genuine intelligence at work here . \nthese are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex . \ntheir plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences . \nthey know what they want , yet temper it with responsibility . \nbut almost always , it's impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster , and it's these episodes that make `american pie' such a carnal delight to watch . \n"""

1,"b'i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean\'s war picture . \ni still think that it doesn\'t deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute\'s list of the 100 greatest american movies . \nand i think that lumet\'s "" 12 angry men "" , wilder\'s "" witness for the prosecution "" and kubrick\'s "" paths of glory "" would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958 . \nbut i can\'t deny the importance of "" the bridge on the river kwai "" - cinematically and in its contents . \nthe film is set in burma in 1943 . \na bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai . \nbut the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn\'t work as simple workmen . \nstruggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect . \nafterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge . \nhe considers it an opportunity to raise his men\'s morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese . \nbut the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . . \na flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people . \nthey are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge . \nand the film doesn\'t consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in "" paths of glory "" . \nlean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies . \nthis is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito . \nin this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is a somehow unpleasant person in the film . \nthe audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson\'s perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not . \nthe spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men . \n ( the plot by-passes these risks . ) \nthat means , the picture isn\'t perfect . \nbut it has a lot of virtues as well . \nit shows the "" madness "" of war and what war can produce in people\'s minds . \nit shows how col . nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics . \nand "" the bridge on the river kwai "" is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests . \nthese points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) . \ndavid lean\'s effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense , especially in the dramatic ( though not wholly plausible ) showdown . \nalec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character . \nthe other actors deliver very good performances as well . \njack hildyard\'s fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful . \ni like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses . \n ( c ) karl rackwitz ( klein k ? ris , germany , 1999 ) \n'"

"" \na la mel gibson in lethal weapon , beck is an emotional wreck , complete with violent outbursts , unscrupulous police methods , and a bleak outlook on life . \nbeck\'s wife has just divorced him , and she is cutting him off from their children . \nshe will not even allow him to wish them "" merry christmas "" by telephone . \nbut beck\'s family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead-bang . \nbeck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop . \nhis investigation starts in l . a . and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma , where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp . \nvirtually every aspect of dead-bang is inept and ineffective . \nthe plot is incoherent and full of holes . \nthe movie depicts beck\'s investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions . \nthe action sequences in dead-bang are strictly third-rate , and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense . \ni certainly expected more from long-time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller , the manchurian candidate--as well as black sunday , seven days in may , and the french connection ii . \nin all fairness to frankenheimer , however , i should note that most of dead-bang\'s shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction . \ndead-bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy , but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting . \naccording to the movie\'s production notes , dead-bang is based on the real-life experiences of still-active detective jerry beck . \nyou would never guess this from watching dead-bang , however , since the film totally lacks credibility ; it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable . \nmost of the characters in dead-bang are either atrociously acted , underdeveloped , superfluous , or all of the above . \nwilliam forsythe , for example , is painfully bad as arthur kressler , a wholesome by-the-book fbi agent who\'s offended by beck\'s foul language and unorthodox methods . \nforsythe\'s lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable . \ndead-bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid ( "" wkrp in cincinnati "" and "" frank\'s place "" ) , but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role ; he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains . \nthe sole function of penelope ann miller\'s character is to give dead-bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less . \ni guess the film\'s title refers to this love scene since it\'s definitely a dead bang . \nthe only real virtue of dead-bang , believe it or not , is don johnson , who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie\'s pitiful script . \njohnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth , and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life . \nand i must admit that dead-bang does have one or two amusing moments . \nthe funniest scene has johnson throwing-up all over a criminal as he interrogates him . \nbut when barf is the highlight of a movie , you know the movie\'s in trouble . \nthe other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck , in which he can\'t keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen . \nbut two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make . \n'"
0,"b'one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself . \nsuch was the case with boxing helena , 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch , daughter of the great david lynch . \nmade in the dying years of post-twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs , it was hyped as another , "" warped , twisted masterpiece "" of lynch clan . \nkim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract . \nbut , the result was extremely disappointing film , which quickly sank into well-deserved oblivion . \nthe movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh ( played by julian sands ) , talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena ( sherilyn fenn ) , beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair . \ncavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re-establish the relationship . \nduring one of such occasions , helena is hit by a car , and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her . \nafter she wakes up , helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh\'s stylish residence , but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping . \nshe is still trying to escape , so cavanaugh takes off her arms . \napart from casting sherilyn fenn ( audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart ) and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies , this film by ms . lynch hasn\'t got anything in common with the works of director\'s more talented father . \ndespite rather bizarre subject , the style of this film is conventional and setting is light , characters are beautiful - but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray . \njennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic - its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos . \nthe actors aren\'t good either . \njulian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man - this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains ; being neurotic doesn\'t suit him . \nbill paxton was better for this role , but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena\'s boyfriend . \nsherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks , but even the her greater effort in acting couldn\'t help this film . \nthe screenplay , on the other hand , is awful , at least for someone who had made best-seller with laura palmer\'s diary - the events in this movie are implausible , characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion . \none of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh\'s "" regular "" girlfriend , played by betsy clarke . \nthe twist at the end , although unpredictable , is unbelievable and the viewers , who had the stomach to endure entire film , would feel cheated . \nall in all , boxing helena is disorganised quasi-artistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basinger\'s career . \n'"
0,"b'the last of vampire-films offers plenty of blood and gore , but beyond that - nothing . \njack crow ( james woods ) is a professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for the vatican . \nhis and his men\'s mission is to clean the earth from vampires . \nthey have lost count of how many vampires they have slaughtered , but one has always escaped them . \nvalek ( thomas ian griffith ) - the dark messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself . \nfor all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation - the black cross . \nwith the cross in their possesion , the vampires will be able to walk in the sunlight . \nafter that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth . . . \ni have never liked john carpenter and his style . \nafter seeing this film , my opinions have not changed . \njohn carpenter remains john carpenter . \nhowever , because of the film\'s self-irony , black humour and fascinating cinematography , i would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long , long time . \nneither the synopses or carpenter\'s direction are original . \nbut there are some things that are interesting . \nthe director\'s negative view on the catholic church , for instance . \nat the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba ( maximilian schell ) has simply used crow and his team to find valek , so that he would gain eternal life . \notherwise the catholic priests are shown cool - drinking , smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy . \ncarpenter has created an interesting atmosphere . \nset in new mexican dessert , he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns , symbolically illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness . \nmore than anything in this film , this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil . \nthe cinematography by gary b . kibbe is probably the film\'s greatest achievement . \nmusic ( composed by john carpenter himself ) is at times effective , the special effects and makeup are likewise worth a notice . \nwhen it comes to the cast ( in an intellectual film like this casting is the last problem ; everyone can scream and swing the axe ! ) , but here james woods is suprisingly convincing . \nhe is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter , who lost his family to the "" breed of evil "" . \nwoods is constantly overacting , which really saves the film from falling into the trap of serious self importance . \ndaniel baldwin is also entertaining as crow\'s loyal partner . \nthe other cast members are struggling . \nbecause the film doesn\'t take itself too seriously , it stays afloat . \nstill it is like most vampire-films - a mediocre experience . \n'"
1,"b""big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america . \no . j . \nsimpson , tom capano , the menendez brothers . \nall these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms . \nand , of course , courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood . \nwhether it be john grisham's thrilling novels or television's famous dramas , the courtroom has always provided big bucks . \nso when i rented a civil action , i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker , a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat . \nhowever , what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected , a major surprise , but fortunately , a pleasant one . \njohn travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it . \nno one expected him to light up the screen in grease , nor in saturday night fever . \nbut , whenever he gets knocked down , he always seems to come back fighting . \na civil action is not john's best performance , but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998 . \ntravolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations . \nhis performance is not flashy , nor memorable , just solid . \nif he delivered the only solid performance , this film would still be average . \nluckily , he has a strong supporting cast . \nwilliam h . macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood . \nhe continues to deliver great performances one after the other , but he is still regarded as a secondary actor . \nin a civil action , he delivers yet another great performance as travolta's paranoid and greedy accountant . \nhe is not a lovable character , but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film . \nhe is not one of the big time lawyers , just a measly accountant . \nbut , he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998 , but there is actually someone better in a civil action . \nrobert duvall is also an underrated actor . \nhe gets many leading roles , but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks , brad pitt and jim carrey . \nduvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co-defendant . \nduvall is magical in this role . \nhe is the wise teacher , who not only battles it out in the courtroom , but also manages to teach every major player a lesson , in his own twisted way . \nin many non-comedic films , directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy , to keep the audience on their toes . \nunfortunately , they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny ( jar-jar binks , anyone ? ) . \nhowever , this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed . \nthis is not the case in a civil action . \nthey have comedy coming from all sides . \nwhether it be duvall's inane questions or macy's sharp anger , the laughs come in a steady pace . \ngranted , it's not roll in the aisle funny , but it provides a nice addition to the film . \nthe plot is terrific- somewhat . \nthe setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom . \nthen the case that will make or break jan ( travolta ) 's career rears its ugly head . \nthey find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it . \nhowever , budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt . \ni will not spoil the rest , although i must speak of the one downside to the film . \nthe courtroom debates are great , but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored . \nit left me somewhat confused , although the rest of the film is terrific . \nall in all , john travolta is back yet again in this great film . \nhis supporting cast , consisting of macy and duvall , turn in tremendous performances , which ease the load on travolta . \nthe film is smart , witty and thought provoking . \nnot only does it gauge in-court battles , but also the various tolls it can take on the major players . \na civil action provides everything a drama lover craves . \n"""
1,"b'he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother . \nshe inspires his love and his fear , and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus . \nhe has a rudimentary grasp of language , mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother\'s phrases . \nhe is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous ; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door . \nhe is 35-years-old in body , but a child in mind and spirit . \nhe is the premise for bad boy bubby , a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby ( nicholas hope ) who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , etc . , etc . then one day his father ( ralph cotterill ) appears . \nhis father is a shabby down-at-heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion . \nunsurprisingly , he is not thrilled with the way "" his "" boy has turned out . \nhe is , however , rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother ( claire benito ) , and , more to the point , her ample breasts . \nsoon they are copulating on the dingy couch , while bubby crouches , confused , in the next room , acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest . \nbubby\'s relationship to the world may be warped , but it is at least stable . \nthe father\'s arrival disturbs his precarious balance , causing an oedipal conflict which ends--freud would be pleased--in violence and , as a result , freedom . \nbubby intuits from his father\'s arrival that the air outside is breathable : he leaves the apartment , his past , his world , behind . \nso far , so good . \nthe first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby , which bring us to this point , are quite brilliant . \nthe movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby\'s hermetic two-room universe . \nit follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise : bubby is used by his mother for sex , he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane , he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins . \nit is grim and savage and appalling , but also strangely tender--de heer , having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby\'s , does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes , but simply empathizes . \nhe observes what it might be like . \nthe intensity of these opening scenes , with their minimalist mise-en-scene , immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world , and owes much to david lynch\'s eraserhead , not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack . \nfor thirty minutes , the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own . \nthen de heer lets bubby out , brings him into contact with our world , and the film never quite recovers . \nour unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide , where he wanders the streets and meets people , where he suffers and learns and survives . \nhe is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band ( how an anti-social half-wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages , wisely ) ; he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress ; he insults a traffic cop and is punched in the stomach ; he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group ; he is imprisoned and raped ; he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension ; he is loved by a motherly large-breasted nurse ( carmel johnson ) . \n . \n . \nit goes on , by turns inventive , silly , tasteless , endearing , and sometimes all of these things at once . \nde heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world : the tone shifts , uneasily , from fable to realism to satire and back again . \nthe scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest ; the film is best understood as a kind of parable , and , indeed , the religious implications of bubby\'s experiences are foregrounded : icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mother\'s walls , bubby dons a priest\'s collar stolen from his father , a church organ-playing atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief , the woman who redeems him is named angel . \nthe manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby\'s mind , do not fragment him into psychosis ; rather , the world accomodates him , and heals him . \nalthough de heer\'s touch is at times overbearing , bubby\'s salvation is touching ; what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na ? ve humanist tale of improbable hope . \na hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community . \nhe returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman , turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art , and turning the band into a popular draw . \ninnocence triumphs . \nbubby becomes a holy fool , an idiot savant , and graces us with wisdom . \nit\'s a strange turn of events , but by now we shouldn\'t be surprised , because bad boy bubby ain\'t like other movies . \n'"
0,"b'the tagline on random hearts reads "" in a perfect world , they never would have met . "" \nin a perfect world , i never would have seen this movie . \nthe biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film , kay chandler ( kristin scott thomas ) and dutch van den broeck ( harrison ford ) are the only two major characters alive ; resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious two-hours-and-then-some production . \ndutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department . \nkay is a congresswoman from new hampshire . \nalthough they both think they are happily married , their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs . \ndutch and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying their partners ; they subsequently discover the affair . \nthe rest of the film is the pointless , unrealistic and often-times boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to , and getting to know each other in the process . \ntwo sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film . \ndutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer , a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare . \nall the great stereotypes get pulled , including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter . \nkay\'s distraction from the film\'s primary focus is her campaign for re-election and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal . \nthese sub plots could have made for semi-interesting points , but the film seems afraid to explore politics or mother-daughter relations in depth , and consequently suffers . \nrandom hearts\' two primary characters seem to live in shells . \nalthough both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots , they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other . \nthere is plenty of opportunity , dutch having a partner and kay having close friends and her daughter , but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships . \nveteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack , and critically acclaimed up-and-comer dylan baker both have cameo roles , but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both . \nother than its weak plot , it is hard to criticize random hearts . \nhowever , it is also hard to compliment it . \nhad the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake , rather than the dry one that equates to be . \n'"
1,"b'i rented this movie with very high hopes . \nthis movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 , and unfortunately , was not as good as i hoped , but was still very intriguing and thought provoking . \nfirst of all , the casting for this film is great . \ntobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood . \nthey play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly . \nwith a plot as unbelievable as this film , you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast . \ntobey and reese ( bud and mary sue parker ) play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability . \nwilliam h . macy , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife , a "" colored "" person and his friends , the "" non-colored "" ones . \nhe also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife . \nhe does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood . \njoan allen is equally great as betty parker , the ideal tv mom . \nher character is the most ambitious . \nshe is very na ? ve , and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that . \nher lack of chemistry with macy , which the role calls for , and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific , and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast , then this film would even been even better . \nas said before , jeff daniels gives a bad performance . \nhis character displays the change going on throughout the town , yet he does not display it with enough conviction . \nhis character is very confusing and he is not very believable . \nthis film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance . \nthe movie is very provocative . \nit challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today . \ni really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up , but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing . \nthey demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch , but do it in a slow pace . \nthe only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length . \nsome films are not meant to be that long . \npleasantville is one of those films . \nthis film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it . \nfirst , they are amazed by the implementation of color . \nthen they want to have it . \nthen they do not want to . \nthen the war ensues between the colored and non-colored . \nthis is all strung out over two hours , which was way too long . \nsome movies need a lot of time . \nsaving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time . \nthis film is only two hours long , and seems much longer . \nlength is everything in films . \nif you can nail down the perfect timing and pace , you can win half the battle . \npleasantville can move at a good pace at times , but it is not consistent enough . \noverall , pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days . \ni went in expecting a light-hearted film about change . \ni left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change . \nluckily , pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences . \nonly if it could have done in a shorter amount of time . \n'"

0,"b'let\'s get this one over with as quickly as possible . \nif there was a possibility to receive a refund , this review would not be forthcoming . \nbut as it is , "" godzilla "" is without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio . \nproducer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch "" last year at merienbad "" until they can grasp the idea of content and plot . \nno amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine ( billy the kid vs . \ndracula ) . \n "" godzilla "" opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs . \nwe are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins ) . \nwell , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature . \nlater , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor . \nin a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word "" gojira "" ( the japanese name of the famed beast ) . \nwe are then introduced to dr . nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film ) . \nhe is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population . \nhe is immediately drafted by the u . s . military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature . \nin a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u . s . and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica . \nwell , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york . \nwhen the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york ) . \nthe military , with dr . tatopoulos\'s help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system . \nit finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr . tatopoulos who snaps the beast\'s picture . \nthe monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage . \nworking from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr . totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated ) . \nwell the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant . \nneedless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster\'s nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn\'t dead yet ) . \ni sincerely hope that i\'ve completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film . \ni gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour\'s wage on this tripe . \neverything about "" godzilla "" reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast . \nthe script ( and let\'s be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years "" razzie "" award . \nthe dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr . tatopoulos\' estranged girlfriend ) and mr . broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed ) . \nthe film could be enjoyably campy if it didn\'t take itself so damn seriously . \nbut to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind . \nno . godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it . \nthe film is bleak and ugly looking . \ntaking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth . \neverything is ugly and dark . \nnew york has never looked so inhospitable since "" death wish "" . \nin an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue . \nthe only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica , where dr . tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint . \nthe scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up . \nyou know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint . \nfor a scientist , this is very poor observation . \nlet\'s look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game ) : \n1 . ) why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs , and how do those eggs fuse into one beast ? \n2 . ) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate ( such as new york ) to nest ? \ni don\'t think iguana\'s have a habit of migrating . \n3 . ) how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system , slice a submarine in half , yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin ( in comparison ) steel cable on the brooklyn bridge ? \n4 . ) the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it\'s suspension cables . \n5 . ) did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly ? \nif so , then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures . \n ( note : each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide . \ngodzilla would have to be over 1 , 000 feet tall to carry them all ) . \n6 . ) godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters , but new york cabs are made of stronger

0,"b'the following review encompasses two versions of dune : \ndune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book . \nthe film\'s visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative . \ndune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television . \nit was disowned by director david lynch but it\'s considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline . \nquality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web . \n * * * the review * * * \nreleased in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert\'s cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans . \ndirector david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico . \nthe screenplay was lynch\'s own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected . \ndune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors . \nthe key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that\'s home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange . \nthe spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe . \nit extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it . \nmost importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to "" fold space "" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish . \nlynch\'s film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story\'s two main strands . \none is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis . \nthe second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen . \nthe deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom . \nunfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended . \nthe thinking among universal\'s oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office . \nwith lynch\'s initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made . \nwhat a great idea ! \nwhy not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? \nthe most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters . \nthus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul\'s father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless . \nthe end result is a distinct chill : we can\'t warm to most of the cast and we don\'t care much for them . \nand it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book . \ndune is also a very serous film . \nthe constant "" self-talk "" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment . \nthe overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them . \nhumour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen\'s mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find . \nyou may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus\' star wars trilogy . \nthe theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however . \nit still possesses enough of lynch\'s stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi . \nspecial effects whiz carlo rambaldi\'s giant sandworms are an awesome sight . \nboth the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original . \nand the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years . \nwith these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis\' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses . \nsee it in the widescreen format if you can . \nand despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen . \nsian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who\'s secret aim is to manipulate paul\'s destiny for its own shadowy ends . \nas paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade . \nthe conclusion ? \nany assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert\'s original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker . \ndavid lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects . \ndune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release . \nmany chose to stay away altogether , as the film\'s disastrous box office showing attests . \nthe extended version , however , is a rather different beast . \nin 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition "" director\'s cut "" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres . \nbut , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects . \nin a way , then , it is partly lynch\'s own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa . \nstung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director\'s guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with "" allen smithee "" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work . \nhe also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous "" judas booth "" . \ncertainly , looking at the results of mca\'s handiwork there\'s at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object . \nbut these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas . \nmost of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version\'s storyline . \npaul\'s relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously . \nthe political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained . \npaul\'s initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably . \nand as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe . \nas a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv\'s version of dune is clearly superior . \nas a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept . \nthe use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate . \nthere\'s some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order . \nand the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg . \nships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context . \nthis is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so . \nit should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television . \nbut the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn\'t even in herbert\'s book . \nthe scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his "" heart plug "" . \nits a surreal and disturbing episode that\'s very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work . \ndespite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film . \nall up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences . \nunless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the "" alan smithee "" version remains the closest we\'ll get to what the movie should have been . \non repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit . \nstill , as one of this century\'s great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen . \nwith rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga . \n'"
1,"b'set in the late 80\'s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie , less than zero ) , american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie "" genre "" that ellis helped to create . \nchristian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues . \nit seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip . \nas he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel . \ni was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school . \ni read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it . \nas usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn\'t end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore . \ni picked it up and read it , but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers . \nthe movie has a similar effect , but at least it\'s less cryptic than ellis\' novel . \nfor once , a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on . \nboth the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout . \nthe movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman\'s impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does . \nas a result , the film is immensely more entertaining . \nlions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith\'s catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference . \nscreenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it . \nsome cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17 , mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women , and initial reports said the film was unwatchable . \nthankfully , it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger , longer & uncut . \nside note #1 : co-writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill-fated acquaintance of bateman\'s who , after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute , proclaims that she\'s not a lesbian nor has any interest in it . \nthe ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer/director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian . \nit\'s a subtle in-joke and it\'s one i found to be pretty humorous . \ndespite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up-and-comers ( including reese witherspoon ) , most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos . \nthe real draw here is christian bale and his over-the-top performance as patrick bateman . \nwhenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters . \ni always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman , but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being . \nto say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he\'s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger . \none sequence in particular , involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news\' song "" hip to be square "" right before burying an axe in a co-worker\'s head , features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film . \nside note #2 : despite the fact that huey lewis\' "" hip to be square "" and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film , don\'t expect to see them on the soundtrack release . \nhuey lewis expressly requested that his song , featured in a rather large set piece in the film ( much akin to the use of "" stuck in the middle with you "" in reservoir dogs ) , not be included on any soundtrack release . \ni\'m assuming that collins requested the same . \non a similar note , whitney houston\'s cover of "" the greatest love of all "" is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn\'t the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source . \napparently , houston wasn\'t as open about the use of her song as the others were . \na bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film\'s release : that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film . \ndon\'t look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more . \nseveral web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i\'m still undecided . \nthere is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops , old ladies , and cleaning staff with equal gusto . \nthe scene seemed very dream-like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying ( as an example , bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car ) . \ni kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there , but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence , though comic , throws the film off-balance ( which i suppose was the intention ) . \nother than the few flaws i have mentioned , american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film ( although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman\'s reality ) . \ni think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such . \nit may not change anyone\'s life , but it will certainly have an effect . \ni know i will certainly hear "" hip to be square "" in a different context the next time i hear it . \n[r] \n'"
0,"b'i don\'t expect much from eddie murphy these days . \nfor the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another . \nsuch films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures . \nthe biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps . \nthe klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places . \nsherman has just invented a new "" youth drink "" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time . \njanet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) . \nwith love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers . \nwith some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the "" buddy love "" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker . \nbut one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . . \nbecause every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy . \nthen the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes . \nand did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? \nthe movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene . \npure and simple , the klumps is a failure . \nits script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes . \nany sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process . \nit\'s more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash . \nhey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes . \nthe characterization of sherman\'s family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema . \neveryone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough . \nthe grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts . \nthe father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings . \nthe mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone . \nthe brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood . \nsherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to . \nbut the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy . \nthe family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct . \nand you got the feeling that these crass people couldn\'t act like this all the time . \nthe sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic . \nafter a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story . \nits also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line . \neven the best effects can\'t seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days . \nnow that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make . \npeople will be lined up around the block for it . \nthe studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 . \neddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he\'ll play every character in the movie . \ni just can\'t wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself . \n'"

1,"b'every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre : with dramas , it was citizen kane , with arthouse it was pulp fiction , and with comedy it was , well , that jim carrey guy ( okay , so he\'s not a movie , but he did have a huge influence on the genre . \nnot to mention an expensive one . ) \nsometimes a movie even combines them all into a big , sprawling motion picture event , as did forrest gump four years ago . \nwith action films , it was aliens , whic was released to much hype seven years after it\'s equally-innovative parent , alien ( 1979 ) . \ndirected and written by james cameron ( t2 : judgement day , the abyss , true lies ) , the authority on action films , it was a masterful encore to his sci-fi thriller the terminator ( 1984 ) . \nwhile the original alien film was a dark , enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew , james cameron took the big-budget action film with aliens , which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing , although on a much-larger scale . \nand boy , did he take that route ! \ni\'d say at about 165 mph or so . . . \nthe film opens 57 years after the original , with lt . ripley ( weaver ) being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel . \nif you\'ll recall , at the end of alien ripley , the only surviving member , cryogenically "" hibernated "" herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship . \nunfortunately , she thought she\'d only be out for a couple of weeks . . . \nonce she\'s returned to earth , ripley is quickly interrogated by "" the company "" , who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy . \nin truth , they believe her , as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an "" alien advisor "" . \nit seems that the colony planet was a once-breeding ground for the nasty aliens , and now all communication with the planet has been lost . . . \nit doesn\'t exactly take a genius to guess what happens next : ripley agrees , and before you can say "" big mistake "" , she and the half dozen marines , plus the slimy corporate guy ( reiser ) , who has more than it looks like up under his sleeve , are off to the colony . \nwhen they arrive , they find the planet in ruins . \nonly one survivor is found , a little girl , newt , who confirms that , yes , the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system . \nand soon enough , the marines come under attack from the aliens . . . \nwhat happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien sci-fi movie : the action scenes . \ncameron directs them so skillfully , and so suspensefully , that you\'re literally ringing your hands by the time the finale rolls around . \nwhich features , in my opinion , the best fight scene ever recorded on film , as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death . \nmany people will tell you that this film , while being a great action film , has no real drama and is all cliches . \nwell , they would be wrong , my friends . \nif this film had no "" drama "" , then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the 1987 academy awards ? \nthat\'s right , best actress . \nyou know that any action film that has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other than technical stuff like editing and f/x has got to be good . \nin short , aliens combines all the right elements ( great action and f/x , drama , a good plot , good dialogue , and great villains ) into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time . \nthen again , maybe not . \nmovies rise and fall from glory and , sad to say , aliens was wrestled from it\'s throne of best action movie by another cameron film , t2 : judgement day , in 1991 . \nso who will be the next king ? \nwell , let\'s wait until december 19th and see yet another james cameron film-the highest budgeted film of all time-titanic to make that decision . \ni can\'t wait . \n'"

\nthe editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times . \nthe real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego . \nworking from a best- selling novel by nicholas sparks ( which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county ) , di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times . \nits strict adherence to clich ? s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer ( 1998 ) . \nthere simply isn't an original scene in this film . \nthe dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking . \nthis is director mandoki's first film since when a man loves a woman ( 1994 ) , the solid meg ryan/andy garcia romance . \nhe's simply going through the motions with this . \nmessage in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come ( 1998 ) as one of the most misguided romances of the decade . \n"""

0,"b'a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets . \nthe film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities . \nthe result is merely an academic exercise , leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn\'t build on to show them as the poets they were . \non paper , this shouldn\'t have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( "" the secret garden "" ) , a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton ( dangerous liaisons ) , and a capable cast . \nbut the film was done in by its inept script , the unappealing way the film was directed , and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud . \ni found his performance to be the most risible one in the film , with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius , spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade . \nhe , especially , looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be . \nbut when the two of them were together , it looked like a mismatch . \nleonardo\'s rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude , yet we know from rimbaud\'s poetry , that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring . \nthe film opens in post-revolutionary france in 1871 , the 16-year-old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems . \nhe accepts verlaine\'s praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home , and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville . \nonce there , rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household , has an immediate conflict with verlaine\'s busty 18-year-old wife mathilde ( romane ) , and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family\'s money , even though he has nothing else in common with her . \nwhen verlaine states , "" poets can learn from one another , "" rimbaud replies in a haughty tone , "" only if they\'re bad poets . "" \nhe will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship . \nverlaine proves to be weak-willed , beating his wife regularly , and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud . \nwhen mathilde\'s father kicks rimbaud out of the house , verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers . \nit\'s a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets , which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce . \nin brussels , verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail . \nwhile rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19 . \nhe instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gun-runner , and after ten years there , comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37 . \nthe hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying . \nthe film ends on a whimper . . . with \nverlaine talking with rimbaud\'s sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses , which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published . \nthis film was especially annoying because rimbaud\'s poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film , as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry . \ni have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film , but whatever it was , it just didn\'t work . \nit certainly didn\'t bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so-called father of modern poetry . \n'"
1,"b'you\'ve got to love disney . \nno matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it\'s animated . \nkids have to go see the movie . \nthen they have to get the toys . \noh , the video came out ? \ngot to buy it , or risk little billy\'s temper tantrums for the next month . \nall of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom . \nstay at the disneyland hotel ! \nbuy a disney t-shirt ! \neat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick ! \nit\'s both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it . \ndale carnegie should have had it so good . \nwhat\'s most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality . \nyou see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot . \nthe theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not . \nthe plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same . \nhowever , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer . \nluckily , disney\'s latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula . \nthe film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) . \nsoon , china\'s emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china\'s defense . \nwhen the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household . \nfearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army . \nmulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling . \nmulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman\'s role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that "" grace "" is not one of her strong points . \nvery early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one\'s family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task . \nby leaving home to fight in her father\'s place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too . \nas is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film . \ni\'m not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time . \nboth lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan\'s army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga\'s voice translates much better to animation . \nyou have to hear it to understand . \ninterestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan . \nthere is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie . \nit is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney\'s own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing . \nartistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically "" disneyfied "" ethnic tale . \nthere are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu\'s hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast . \nthe other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it . \nwhen mulan resolves to take her father\'s place , she dons her father\'s old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword . \nas she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal . \nit just left me thinking , "" that was really cool . "" \na wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang\'s conscripted army . \neven more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan . \nalthough an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance . \ni found the choice of b . d . \nwong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short\'s wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything\'s possible . \nin any event , wong performs admirably as well . \none character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa . \nshe deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people . \njune foray , who supplies grandmother fa\'s speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha ) . \nmarni nixon , who provides grandmother fa\'s singing voice , is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i , maria in west side story , and eliza in my fair lady . \nwith this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history . \nmulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films . \nin an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a "" miss saigon "" -type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian-american actors for both lead and supporting roles . \nin addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei . \ni guess clyde kusatsu wasn\'t available . \nat a running time of slightly under an hour and a half , mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and , happily , adults . \nthis is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next , rather than hope that the next one is better . \n'"
1,"b'in my review of there\'s something about mary , i said something to the effect of "" laughter isn\'t everything . "" \ni now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate : laughter isn\'t everything , unless i\'m watching a jim abrahams film . \nsee , spoofs are easy with me . \ni love movies , and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love . \nsometimes i\'m the only one in the theater laughing . \nsometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high-pitched in comparison to my speaking voice ( it cuts right through everyone else\'s laughter ) . \nsometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film . \nabraham\'s latest film , mafia ! , induced this kind of hysteria upon me . \nit\'s gotten some mediocre reviews , but , hey , i\'m the guy who laughs at everything . \nthere may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film , but there are far more that work , and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness . \ni enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought-provoking . \nmost lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things , like develop characters , shape stories , and other such nonsense . \nmafia ! \nhas no pretentions about characters or story , and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh . \nthe film begins on the perfect high note , with a mockery of the opening of casino . \nour hero ( jay mohr ) is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car , which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire . \nto describe the story of mafia ! \nis absurd and pointless , but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films , with a lot of casino references inserted throughout . \nalong the way , the parodies seem arbitrary , and rarely victimize mob films : pictures like the english patient , forrest gump , and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing . \nmovies like this rely on just a few things , but the most important element is direction . \nabrahams has been down this path many times before ( hot shots ! , top secret ! , airplane ! , and any other film with an exclamation point in the title ) , and so i hold most of the success of mafia ! \nto his experience . \nhe takes just the right attitude in each scene , and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references ( one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic , but it never develops ) . \nthe actors are all energetic , which helps a lot with the tone of the film . \nmohr ( suicide kings , paulie ) , who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors , is so good here . \nhe looks like he\'s having so much fun that he\'s containing his laughter in every scene ( watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool ) . \nhe\'s probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material . \nlloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando\'s godfather , while pamela gidley is dead-on in a full-blown mockery of sharon stone . \nthe hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i\'m supposed to give examples of things and be specific . \nunfortunately , i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia ! \nthat i can\'t remember a lot of what made me laugh . \nbut that\'s a good sign : mafia ! \nis so funny that i wasn\'t even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory . \ni laughed so hard that it shut off my brain . \ni know that doesn\'t sound particularly complimentary , but when watching a dumb comedy like this , the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain . \nfinally , a film that does this for me . \n'"
1,"b""i don't box with kid gloves . \ni don't play nice , i'm not a nice guy , and i never , ever , go easy on a film . \ni consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic . \nhowever , i do some favors , and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery . \nrigormortis , the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking , gets several of these points each time . \ni still , however , will not go easy on them . \nthey recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy ( which begins , quite wittily , with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film . ) and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it . \nin the famous lines of many martyrs , i have no regrets . \nwell , i do have some regrets , but that is not the point in the previous sentence . \nthe point of it was that down with america was a film that , from a critical standpoint , did not entirely disappoint me . \nsure , the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain , and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films , but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable . \ndown with america concerns a government agent , needless murder , and a book containing everything from the unabomber's manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report . \nlike the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed , it displays an off-kilter humor and intelligence ? it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail . \nthe best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s . \na dying movement from the day they started , these paranoid `thrillers' had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word : `roswell . ' \nin down with america , the line `roswell' is highly absent . \nwith an about ten minute running time , down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich ? that the conspiracy films fell into , makes jokes at them at the same time , and provides us with funny and memorable characters . \nagain , i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn't care less about . \nthe film , as previously stated , concerns a federal agent ( peter roach ) , an obsessed librarian ( meri stevens ) , a mystery man ( joe kaczkowski ) , and two people obsessed with silence in the library ( robb sherman , kevin flowers ) . \nthe plot : a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in ? a public library where it can be viewed by all . \nfrom there we go into a delightful parody . \nthe federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth , the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books . \nwe spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast . \nalthough the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to `no-name' , it ends up being the no-name people who do a good job , delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out . \nfor once , i don't have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online . \ni can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l'auto and les x-files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself . \nit's almost as much fun as the film . \n"""

1,"b'the long and illustrious career of robin williams , which has included both forgettable turns like mrs . \ndoubtfire and flubber , was punctuated with the actor\'s first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting . \nit was his first truly dramatic role since 1989\'s dead poets society , and critical remarks were unanimously positive . \nhis next role , that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come , was unfortunately lackluster . \nand so , after a six-year stint as a comedic actor , the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams . \nwilliams is the title character , hunter "" patch "" adams , sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean-shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting . \nwe\'re introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies . \nit\'s at the institution , however , that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people . \nhe removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia\'s medical college , where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating , impersonal trade . \nhis attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion , and the movie climaxes with patch\'s appearance before the state medical board . \nthe characters are well-defined in an oscar-worthy sense . \nalthough the script does not perform well as a narrative -- there\'s little story to be told outside of patch\'s skit-length experiences -- the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters . \nat medical school , patch meets up with truman schiff ( daniel london ) , an outsider like himself who relishes patch\'s zest for humanity . \nthe two instantly become the best of friends , and it\'s easy to see why . \nmonica potter plays patch\'s love interest , a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school . \nfor some reason he\'s attracted to her , and although it never gets said , the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view . \nthe script -- based on hunter adams\' own story -- works well this way . \nthe rest of the cast , bob gunton as the villain professor in particular , is solid . \ndirector tom shadyac ( liar liar ) leads us in and out of patch\'s life in a sound , intentional manner ; combined with williams\' presence on screen , the movie rarely becomes boring . \npatch adams\' lack of purpose is its major shortcoming , and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours , there\'s little feeling of continuity or the passage of time . \nnevertheless , it\'s an emotionally moving picture , and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season . \nit succeeds at everything it tries , and only fails at the stuff it doesn\'t try in the first place . \nby and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams , but more importantly , it\'s entertainment for the entire family . \n'"

1,"b'we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist . \nyears later we see his subsequent resurfacing ; in the mid 80\'s a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world . \nthe movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown . \nbased on the life story of david helfgott , this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a child-genius , compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father . \nin the 1950\'s helfgott emerged as a child prodigy . \nthe film traces his relationship with his father , whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys . \ndavid is offered places in the usa , but his father refuses to let him leave australia . \nthe effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot ; david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teacher\'s house . \nhe is well lit via the external house lights . \nhis teacher isn\'t home . \nwe pull back and see that the dark front room\'s window has it\'s curtains open . \nthere , in a pool of blackness , is a grand piano . \ndavid\'s fall over the dark cliff has begun . \ninstead of being told in a linear mode , shine jumps around in time , ala "" pulp fiction "" . \nthis narrative device works well ; we see david as a boy , teenager in london and mental-patient in various snippets . \nthe film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion . \nadult-helfgott\'s return to the light is told in linear fashion . \nthe lead role is played by 3 different actors , with the teenage-david ( taylor ) and adult-david ( rush ) standing out . \nwhilst rush is known for his tv work in australia , i think this is his first major cinema work . \nhis david , whilst clearly damaged - he keeps quoting his "" daddy "" in a babbling word torrent , cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts - is both touching and funny . \ntaylor\'s teenage-david is the more sympathy producing role . \nwe are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building . \nhis father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninov\'s 3rd , whilst his teacher wants to start him with a simple mozart . \ntechnically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production . \ni particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects . \none scene has adult-helfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain . \nthe sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice . \nwith a clever subtlety , the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping , but of the same beat . \nthe image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd . \nbut it\'s us being clapped . \nwe are young-david walking up to the stage for our first public show . \nthe music , as you would expect from a film of this subject matter , is critical . \nand it works very well . \nthe \'miming\' of the actors piano playing is faultless ( apparently rush didn\'t mime ; he really did play ) \nhelfgott\'s life is certainly not without it\'s sympathetic people . \nindeed his return to the \'normal\' world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women . \nhis ultimately uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft . \nit shows that with the \'help of god\' we can all find our way back home . \n'"

1,"b'i\'m not quite sure what to say about mars attacks ! , which is obviously the work of a deranged genius . \nwhen tim burton\'s twisted alien invasion comedy really works , it\'s breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure . \nand when it doesn\'t work , it\'s just dull . \ni\'m not even sure it works more often than it doesn\'t , but where it counts -- that is , when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come -- mars attacks ! \nis brilliant . \nmars attacks ! \nis based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer\'s independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big-budget special effects extravaganzas . \nbut unlike independence day , which was a painfully middle-of-the-road appeal to the hearts , minds and wallets of america , mars attacks ! \nhas a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it . \nthe big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings , mars attacks ! \nportrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are . \nthe title sequence is just splendid -- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation . \nthe spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past , and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman\'s thundering , theremin-driven score is absolutely jaw-dropping . \nit\'s so overwhelming that , i swear to you , i had trouble breathing . \nthe movie lays low for the next 40 minutes . \nwe get a glimpse of the alien leader , resplendent in a purple-sequined cape , when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world -- naturally , the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming . \nbut mostly , the first act is spent developing characters , setting up mildly comic situations , and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton . \nit\'s a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens , because burton\'s just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars . \nanyone who comes to mars attacks ! \nexpecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed -- with few exceptions , these characters are dispatched as the film progresses . \njack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer . rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr . strangelove\'s buck turgidson , glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady , and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house\'s "" kennedy room , "" a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big-haired , pointy-breasted sexpot ( lisa marie , the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood ) -- in an earlier scene , it\'s made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy . \nsarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j . fox is her newsman husband . \nthe octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles , "" they blew up congress ! "" \nand plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace . \njim brown and tom jones are the film\'s vegas-based heroes , and director barbet schroeder ( reversal of fortune ) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president . \nalso on hand and underutilized are annette bening , pierce brosnan , pam grier , lukas haas and natalie portman ( the latter two also show up in woody allen\'s everyone says i love you ) . \nthe real stars , of course , are the computer-generated martians , and they\'re fantastic . \nwith bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull-faces , round egg-eyes with red pupils darting this way and that , these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate -- joe dante\'s gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory , but burton\'s little monsters are more inventive . \nthe film\'s raison d\'etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind -- the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault , easter island is turned into a bowling alley , and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans . \nthe sheer level of mayhem is staggering , especially when the aliens make their first attack , blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons . \nparents are urged to pay special attention to the pg-13 rating -- it\'s earned . \nthe special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy , and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day , although mars attacks ! \nwas in production long before that film\'s release . \ncinematographer peter suschitzky , who makes the most of wynn thomas\'s wildly imaginative production design ( thomas helped define the spike lee style ) , actually took time off from his mars attacks ! \nregimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg . \ncronenberg\'s movie will almost certainly be more somber -- it won\'t be released in the u . s . until early next year -- but mars attacks ! \nis surely a similarly elegant nightmare . \nthis is not a nice movie . \n ( and which studio executive was duped into giving burton $70 million to make it ? ) \nby setting the film\'s final scenes in the nearly empty , holocaust-ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided , burton\'s invasion epic suggests that the world we\'ve got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead . \nthe victims of his invasion are naive , greedy , or disastrously self-absorbed -- and a good thing , too , since the movie\'s wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish-fulfillment fantasy . \nthe surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers , who triumph by determining that the alien invaders -- the ultimate elitists -- are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture . \nultimately , this messy masterpiece is the year\'s funniest comedy and a weird , winking affirmation of the power of the people . \n'"

"" \n--- blatz balinski ( danica sheridan ) laments the fact that her lesbian lover , april ( kristen holly smith ) , has just received a telegram from her ex-fiance . \nisle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot ( smith ) , a resident of the small town of bumfuck , arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson ( michael dotson ) . \nwhen april gets extreme cold feet she runs home , sticks a gun in her mouth , and pulls the trigger . \ninstead of killing herself , she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos , an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed ( except for lance , the homosexual toilet cleaner/slave ) . \napril loves her new home and friends , but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up . \nmr . and ms . pfferpot ( director jeff b . harmon and janet krajeski ) decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr . sigmoid colon ( also jeff b . harmon ) , who claims he can cure homosexuality . \nin actuality , dr . colon is homosexual as well and begins his special "" treatment "" on dick dickson ( unbeknownst to dick ) . \nwhen april turns down dick\'s demand for her to return to bumfuck , he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo-style . \ninstead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance ( alex boling ) and the two of them , along with april and her lover blatz , get married . \n ( note to the filmmaker : why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i\'m assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided ? ) \napril\'s parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way . \nthe bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the "" circuitry "" and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d . c . , destroying it . \nmr . and ms . pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own . \ni\'m not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b . harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs . \neither way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie . \nthe film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about "" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews "" . \nif harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can\'t help but feel like he had some serious intent . \nas for the entire central theme of the movie , i\'m afraid that it\'s one that i just don\'t get . \ni tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes . \nit was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society . \nhow does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ? \ni\'m not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don\'t force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren\'t going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me . \nagain , maybe i\'m missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully . \nas far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy . \ndespite the disturbing visuals , "" mom and apple pie "" stuck with me for the rest of the day . \nspeaking of disturbing visuals , "" wedding bells ain\'t ringing "" could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying . \n "" i\'m a lesbian "" ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms . smith . \nit\'s mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based . \nthe other performers are decent , save for the rosie o\'donnell like performance given by danica sheridan . \ni have no inherent problem with her character ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired . \none particular musical number , "" lesbian rock "" , was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan . \nthe film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll . \nthe remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs ( "" lesbian rock "" included ) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film . \nonce the "" isle of lesbos reprise "" was reached , i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all . \nwhy was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ? \nisle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www . indie-underground . com . \nthe transfer is pretty clean ( and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent ) and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 . 85 : 1 . \nin many respects , isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential ( like a rocky horror for the new millennium ) . \nthis film is by no means my cup of tea , but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it . \nif you think it might be for you , then by all means seek it out . \ni , on the other hand , will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator . . . \nwait . aren\'t gladiator films considered to be . . . \noh , never mind . \n'"
0,"b""while i am not fond of any writer's use of cheap , easy puns , i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it ( witness my review of _pecker_ from a couple of issues ago ) . \nso here goes : the juvenile , college-set black comedy _dead_man_on_campus_ is dead on arrival . \nstrait-laced med student josh ( tom everett scott , who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout ) 's blemish-free academic record breaks out into fs , thanks to the influence of his ever-partying roommate , cooper ( mark-paul gosselaar ) , who introduces josh to the sex- and booze-filled nights that come with university life . \nwith the threat of losing an academic scholarship ( josh ) and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming ( cooper ) , what are two good-hearted slackers to do ? \neasy--look for a loophole , which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student's ( or students' ) roommate commits suicide , the surviving student ( s ) shall receive straight as . \nso instead of studying , josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there , move him into their dorm room , and drive him to suicide before the semester ends . \ndirector alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white ( working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder ) take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper's diabolical plot . \nuntil then , the usual boring cliches of college life ( booze , sex , more booze ) fill the time , which is made to feel longer by _saved_by_the_bell_ alumnus gosselaar's sitcom-bred mugging . \nthat said , once cohn and company do build some comic momentum , they mishandle it . \nthe introduction of the manic , psychotic cliff ( lochlyn munro ) , a potential roommate for josh and cooper , brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates : paranoid nerd buckley ( randy pearlstein ) and british death rocker matt ( corey page ) . \none wishes that cliff would reappear , but , as they say , be careful what you wish for . \nnot surprisingly , he does resurface , and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose ; almost immediately , his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty . \nthe same can be said about all of _dead_man_on_campus_ . \nwhatever morbid appeal the far-fetched premise has quickly evaporates , and the self-absorbed characters , especially cooper , pretty much grate from the get-go . \n_dead_man_ doesn't grow tiresome ; it already _is_ once the clever opening titles are through . \nas it slogs along to a cheesy , happy-for-all-parties conclusion , _dead_man_ lives up to its title and then some--not only does the movie grow even more tired and die , it still insists on going on . . . \nlike a zombie . \n"""
1,"b'us critic-type people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies aren\'t thrill rides , but i think that "" back to the future ii "" is one of the few exceptions . \nif the original film had the spirit of the 1950s , then this has the spirit of the 80s : full of fights ; chase scenes ; cliff hangers ; special effects ; some detective work ; and of course the vision of the high-tech future . \nthe film picks up exactly where the first film left off , with doc ( lloyd ) , marty ( fox ) , and jennifer ( elizabeth shue ) travelling 30 years into the future , because something bad is going to happen to marty and jennifer\'s kids . \ndoc tells marty he must take his son\'s place at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr . says yes to griff ( wilson - in one of four different roles ) . \nwhoever said history tends to repeat itself wasn\'t joking , especially when it comes to the movies . \nessentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place again in the year 2015 , but it\'s not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously a parody of itself . \nat the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better , and it seems like everything\'s copasetic right ? \nwrong . \nsince when do things go according to plan in the "" back to the future "" movies ? \nthere are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story i won\'t even bother to list them all . \nbasically we get to see marty as an old man , his house , his family , etc . we also go back to an alternate 1985 , and then back again to 1955 , with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath . \nthe films\' best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie and shows a lot of the action that occurred from another angle . \nit\'s difficult to convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail . \nthe only thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense . \ninstead of a grand finale , we get lots of little victories . \nby the end everything is back to normal , but something happens that leads to yet another sequel , but it doesn\'t seem gratuitous . \n "" back to the future part ii "" is a really great adventure movie . \nit certainly has more originality than other films but it lacks a certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor . \n'"
1,"b'the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of "" leila , "" a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features . \nalthough unfamiliar with mehrjui\'s previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers . \nset in modern-day iran , "" leila "" begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) . \nas leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn\'t quite as sweet . \nearlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child . \nwhen all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn\'t care at all about having children . \nnonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) . \nbluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with . \nleila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens\' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn\'t give her full blessing . \nthere are no easy answers to be found within "" leila , "" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character\'s unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration . \nalmost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law\'s requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman . \nmaybe because "" leila "" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence . \nleila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances . \none of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply . \nit is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible . \nalthough seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another . \nditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her . \nthese "" small "" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman . \nleft there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer . \nrefusing to stay over at her parent\'s house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below . \ndespite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him . \nsure , the whole second marriage was his mother\'s idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn\'t he ? \nin the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair . \nunlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words . \nevery bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else . \nfor all of its strong aspects , "" leila "" isn\'t a perfect film . \non a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed . \nand concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before . \nmehrjui\'s decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi . \ndespite these minor missteps , "" leila "" is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york\'s cinema village , and then on may 21 in la . \nthe thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila\'s self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return . \nit\'s difficult to not consider how leila\'s culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through . \n'"
0,"b""deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie . \nthis overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises , and , being true to its title , being deceptive . \nbut there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit . \nbraxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute ( renee zellweger ) . \ntheir lone suspect is wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker's pocket . \nhowever , a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators , as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables . \nbraxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives . \nbraxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook ( ellen burstyn ) , a local bookie . \nkennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite ( rosanna arquette ) , believing his wife to be unfaithful . \nthe plot is twisty and complex , with lots of lengthy flashbacks , and plenty of surprises . \nhowever , there are times when it is needlessly complex , and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost . \ntake a look at l . a . confidential , or the film's more likely inspiration , the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled . \nthe dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot . \nfor example , the film tells a few substories ( such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender , or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear ) , but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable . \nthere's never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation . \nthey appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay . \nthe characters , themselves , are rather pathetic and despicable . \nnot one of them is an ounce sympathetic , and as a result , the labyrinthine plot is all for naught . \nwhat does it matter who is guilty of what and why ? \nwriter-directors josh and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers' masterwork blood simple , or the wachowski brothers' less worthy bound . \nbut , while they have got the plot twists down cold , they need to work on characterization and dialogue . \n"""

"" \ndicaprio is a revelation . \ni hadn\'t seen him before in anything , and didn\'t know what the heck to expect , really . \n ( honestly , i expected a bad irish accent , but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea , so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game . ) \ndicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive , and being on the titanic , that it\'s hard not to like him . \nfrom the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg , dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest , and he never falters . \nwinslet\'s character grows up a lot during the movie , and so does her performance . \nat first , she\'s not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop-dead gorgeous . \nwe know from the narration that she\'s monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane , but there isn\'t any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio . \nwinslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg . \nit\'s at that moment where winslet\'s character really comes alive . \nfaced with real danger , she drops her spoiled-rich-girl mannerisms and does a splendid job . \nas rose and jack race around the doomed ship , looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal\'s fiery temper , winslet turns in a superb acting performance , mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror . \nof course , the most interesting character is the ship itself . \ncameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic , and shows her in every mood -- as a deserted wreck , down in the boiler room , up on the bridge , down in the hold , at the captain\'s table , down in steerage -- and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead . \ncameron\'s greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well . \n'"
1,"b'unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric . \nostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . \nmany scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . \nthe cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . \ndirector douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi\'s lover at the time ) freely admits that he "" couldn\'t care less about the truth "" but was more interested in capturing "" the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . "" \ndespite violating nearly every rule of "" legitimate "" documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment . \nwhile it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi . \nthis man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he\'s funny , energetic , and eminently quotable . \nhe has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( "" it\'s about women not wanting to look like cows "" ) to mary tyler moore ( "" between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country "" ) to style ( "" it\'s almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs "" ) . \nunzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress . \nit\'s almost certainly different that anyone would imagine . \nthe designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection . \nin particular , unzipped traces mizrahi\'s development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista . \non the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . \na variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . \nthere is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience\'s perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . \nnevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . \nwhile unzipped isn\'t an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . \noverall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . \nwhen the designer declares that "" everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that\'s beautiful and liberating , "" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed . \n'"
0,"b'synopsis : lifelong friends rafe ( affleck ) and danny ( hartnett ) join the us air force and are stationed at pearl harbor , hawaii . \nrafe goes to england to fight alongside british pilots and is seemingly killed in action . \ndanny falls in love with rafe\'s girlfriend , evelyn ( beckinsale ) , but rafe survives and returns to confront his former friend . \nmeanwhile , the japanese sneak attack is imminent . . . \nreview : "" pearl harbor "" is a perfect example of movies as product rather than as art . \nit is little more than a crassly-calculated attempt to woo the masses , enticing them with big stars , big effects , and a big setting -- but no heart . \nit is difficult to criticise the actors , because they do everything the movie demands of them . \nsadly , this amounts to barely more than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to see the script randall wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time as he was writing "" pearl harbor "" with his left . \nthe plot here is pure cliche , and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop . \nthere is no genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant to the united states , and no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join world war ii . \ninstead , there is just an assembly-line love triangle , some empty patriotic rhetoric , and a laughable attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial commanders ( when one intones , "" i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant "" , i nearly fell out of my seat ) . \nto the movie\'s credit , it does include a fantastic portrayal of the attack itself , an exciting and dizzying hour which plunges viewers into the war . \nif only the remaining two hours had been crafted with such skill , perhaps this memorial day non-event would have been worth watching . \n'"
0,"b""well , what are you going to expect ? \nit's a movie about a big snake that eats people . \nthat's what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film , because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more . \ninstead , i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me , too . \nanaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river . \nled by anthropologists dr . steven cale ( eric stolz ) and terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives . \nalong the way , they find poacher paul sarone ( jon voight ) , and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda . \nto simply say that this is the world's largest snake wouldn't be doing it justice , since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide . \nif this isn't a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers , i don't know what is . \nat the beginning of anaconda , we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past , but that seems to be more or less over now . \ni expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line , but it ended up being a set-up for nothing . \ncale chokes on a deadly wasp ( don't ask me how that happens - i don't know ) and is put out of action , relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help . \nthis minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot , since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone's plan to capture the snake . \nhowever , this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film , and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle . \nmost bad characters are either annoying or stupid . \nin this movie , they're both . \nsince this description applies to all the characters except sarone , it's hard to find someone to root for . \nyou're supposed to back the good guys , but you really end up cheering for sarone because he's smarter than everyone else . \nor maybe he's just not as dumb as everyone else . \nat times , i almost found myself rooting for the snake . \nthere are no standout performances here . \neveryone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters . \neven voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason . \nno matter , as in most monster movies , the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway . \nin most of the scenes , the snake is computer generated , and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real . \nhowever , the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences . \nsometimes , for example , the snake just moves too fast . \nit catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall , for crying out loud . \nthen there's another scene where the snake eats one of the characters , and we see the snake's skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim's pained expression from within the snake's belly . \nabsolutely ridiculous . \na testimony to the film's bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film , where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is . \nin a scene totally unrelated to anything else , we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther . \nthe anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard , one of the panther's eyeballs pops out . \neeeewwwww . \nabove and beyond the sick factor , however , this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed . \nin films like these , a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained . \nif the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see , we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them . \nto show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don't know about , and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown . \nin a case like that , the showdown just ends up being a letdown . \nwhen i saw the snake for the first time , i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasn't the real danger . \nthis one was just a decoy , and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe . \nno such luck . \nokay , maybe anaconda is actually a decoy , and there's really a better movie waiting to make its debut . \n"""

0,"b'seen december 2 , 1997 at 6 : 50 p . m . at the glenwood movieplex cinemas ( oneida , ny ) , theater #3 , by myself for free ( free pass ) . \n[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] \nthere are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons . \nthey provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation . \nwatching "" flubber "" really clinched this idea for me , because it\'s just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy . \nit proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story . \nthe film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere . \nwe meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist . \nwithin the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is . \nphillip\'s memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer\'s disease - isn\'t this rather lowbrow comedy ? \nhe starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids\' movie if i ever saw one ) . \nwe learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he\'s forgotten . \nsara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she\'ll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) . \nbut even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it\'s no surprise the major conflicts here are related . \nchristopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip\'s ideas , but his woman too . \nwhat\'s worse is that sara actually seems interested in him ! \nwilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day . \none of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film . \nthe flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter . \nit\'s obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny . \nunfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing . \nflubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object . \nmost of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip\'s absent-mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along . \nbut it\'s clear how weak this premise is from the get-go and the film just gets worse . \nall the jokes involve people getting hit by fast-moving , flubber-powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that don\'t fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air . \nit\'s all presented with complete logic , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes . \nduring the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , "" i think they might be cheating , "" to which the referee replies , "" there\'s no rules about jumping too high . "" \n "" predictable "" doesn\'t begin to describe the motions the film goes through , especially after the halfway point . \nand it\'s not how terribly contrived the plot is , it\'s the way it\'s broken down scene-by-scene , with absolutely no transition . \nnot only that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears . \ni\'d say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , so it\'s almost forgivable when you realize they\'re talking to nothing and interacting with nothing . \nit\'s safe to say everything that could be bad about "" flubber "" is . \nthe only original element the film has is the world\'s first romance between a machine and a human . \nbut this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you won\'t . \n'"

1,"b""earlier this year , the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics . \na real charmer of a movie , it's possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience . \nnow , at the end of 1998 , comes waking ned devine , a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter . \nthere's no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere -- they strike all the same chords -- but still , ned devine is a movie worth seeing . \nthe plot is interesting and robust : the latest lottery winner is ned devine ( jimmy keogh ) , of tullymore , ireland . \nned's prize is over six million pounds , but the shock of winning killed the poor old man , and the check remains unclaimed . \nenter jackie o'shea ( ian bannen ) and michael o'sullivan ( david kelly ) , the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village . \nthe two men eventually find the ticket , and decide that if michael can convince the lotto authorities that he's actually ned , the entire town can reap the benefits ; their only adversary is an ancient old woman ( eileen dromey ) who sees more profit in reporting the fraud . \nian bannen and david kelly truly shine as jackie and michael . \njackie , stocky and large , is the brains behind the operation ; michael , scrawny and short , is the method man . \nthe two contrast each other delightfully , and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience . \nevery viewer is sure to like both of them . \nthere are other minor subplots included as well , such as an unlikely romance between a local girl and the town pig farmer . \nthis appears quite inconsequential until the end , and even with a startling revelation it's a tad bit unnecessary . \noverall , waking ned devine has a predictable outcome , and plot twists are never really taken seriously . \nthe ending , a very hilarious and very ironic twist of fate , somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout . \nthe kirk jones script is indeed off-the-cuff . \nin a way , waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents : warm , friendly , outgoing , and jovial . \nit's the perfect kind of comedy , a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic cast of characters and a string of jokes . \nthere's nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moment or two , because the spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted one . \nindeed , it's one of the year's best feel-good movies -- 91 minutes of unrestrained joy that no one should miss . \n"""

1,"b'most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts . \nmy family , for the most part , hates him and his movies . \ni think he\'s very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years . \nso maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of . \nunrestrained by physical boundaries , allen\'s humor comes shining through . \nthose who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen\'s intelligent observations of life . \nthose who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one . \nin 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they\'d never seen before . \ntoy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present . \nmany critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture . \nantz , however , has upped the ante considerably . \ndisney\'s a bug\'s life isn\'t due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal . \nby beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience\'s thirst for computer-animated films . \nbut don\'t let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared . \nin the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios . \nin 1997 , it was the volcano duel . \nin my opinion , dante\'s peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality . \nvolcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations . \nin 1998 , there are twice as many competing films . \nfirst was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it\'s cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact . \nbut now , it\'s even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks ) . \nwho will prevail ? \ntime will tell , but i\'m sure that mr . mouse has nothing to fear . \nthis may sound like i didn\'t like antz ; on the contrary , i\'d put it up there with toy story . \nbut due to it\'s pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn\'t appear in disney\'s version . \nsome of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film . \nsexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks\' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd . \nthe humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended . \nthis is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents . \nantz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen\'s shtick and franz kafka\'s metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug . \nz ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker . \n "" when you\'re the middle child in a family of five million . . . "" he comments about his neglected childhood . \none night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life . \nin walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown . \nbala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader . \nafter discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there\'s a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony . \nin order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants . \nbut to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her . \nhe and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed . \nthe queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony . \nmeanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him . \nso z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites . \nthe battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence . \nhowever , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence . \nthe second half of the film revolves around z\'s kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia . \nthere , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants . \nthe adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass . \nlooming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i\'m just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) . \nthe ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground . \nvisually , it\'s an exciting rush of adrenaline . \nbut don\'t be fooled . . . \nlittle kids shouldn\'t see this , as they may just try and copy it . \nafter seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again . \nhopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel . \nas an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date . \nvisually , it\'s as stunning as what dreams may come . \nthe best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren\'t limited by gravity . \nthey can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible . \none great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball . \nthe animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball . \nhowever , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy\'s shoe . \nit\'s truly a great example of film making at its finest . \nwith computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants\' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices . \nthe best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) . \nat one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . . \ndo they ? ) . \nbarbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body . \nyoung kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) . \ndisney\'s a bug\'s life looks good , but i don\'t know if they will be able to best dreamworks\' newest animated feature in terms of animation . \nif not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) . \nvocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story . \nin fact , it far exceeds that one . \nwoody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he\'s done in the past few years . \nwithout a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing . \nin fact , i\'m pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines . \nsharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress . \nsylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star . \nafter a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is . \ngene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona . \nchristopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns . \nanne bancroft has a minimal role , but she\'s effective nonetheless . \ndanny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job . \ndan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd . \njennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won\'t recognize her voice either . \nmany people will recognize grant shaud\'s voice as the foreman . \nhe played miles on the tv show murphy brown . \nthis is definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names , and it will definitely help it\'s grosses . \nof course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to , also . \ndirectors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) . \nbut both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture . \ntense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals . \nthe screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults . \nkids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor . \nmost of it will go over young children\'s heads . \ndoes that mean you shouldn\'t take kids to see it ? \nnot at all . \nthey will have a lot of fun watching this one . \nwhat is great is the themes that are given to us . \npart social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community . \nthankfully , it\'s not subtle in either aspects . \nantz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action . \nsometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home . \nthe battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death . \nand the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight . \nbut other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it\'s a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters . \ni doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it\'s still advisable to leave really young children at home . \nhave i confused you enough ? \nif you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely , you\'ll enjoy it the most . \n'"

1,"b'showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer . \ntheir last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone\'s taste , but certainly a well-crafted movie . \npossibly that movie\'s greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie . . . \nand that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters\' future , so there was no need to film it . \nthere was actually about four hours\' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on-screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails . \nthe major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls . \nwe have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who\'s trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do . . . \nbut recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner . \nin this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who\'s not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we\'re left feeling good about her future . \nthis is not one of the great movies , but it\'s far better than we\'d been led to expect by all the negative pre-release publicity . \nverhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter-century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially-acceptable limits to movie-making . \nhis most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back-door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he\'s exploring the sleeze . \nthis movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director\'s contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie . \n ( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video . ) \nmany reviewers have taken the politically-correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it\'s about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist . \nit\'s about the scum who use other people as power-trip toys , and the need to escape their power . \nit\'s about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don\'t pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment . \nan nc-17 movie which isn\'t sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty , power , or value . \nthe one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool , is not exciting , because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator . \nif anything , it\'s a rape scene with a victim who\'s been duped into cooperation . \nyou don\'t make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors ; you don\'t make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed ; and you don\'t make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls . . . \nand in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing . \nthis is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry , in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity . \nshowgirls de-glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness . \nnomi is played , in a very good performance , by elizabeth berkley , who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who\'s at the end of her rope , desperate to live a life better than the one she\'s known . \nshe has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability , and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker , trying to be something better than she seems destined to be . \nwhen nomi realizes she\'s gone too far for too little , she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be . \ngina rivera plays molly , a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi , providing her with what may be the one solid , positive relationship in nomi\'s entire life . \nmolly is the one who makes the difference , and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she\'ll be using for the rest of her life , and nomi\'s feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi\'s decision . \ngina gershon plays cristal , an aging , but still very attractive starring dancer , a reflexively competitive manipulator who\'s become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her . \ngershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch ; a fading talent made bitter by self-awareness . \nher character is very well drawn and performed ; in a major scene in a hospital room , she acknowledges what she is , and , in essence , passes the torch to nomi . \nthe relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie , and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path . \nit is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe ; molly is an honest , hard-working person who means well , and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality . \ncristal is a talented dancer who\'s compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co-operating part of the system , exchanging self-respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas . \nnomi believes she can make it without selling herself , succumbs to a degree , and then realizes she can make it without selling herself , and doesn\'t need las vegas or its brand of "" stardom . "" \nthe male parts in this movie are simply props ; they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist . \nkyle maclachlan , whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden , gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs , camouflaged as a nice guy . \nglenn plummer plays a dancer who\'s working as a bellboy , and provides a bit of alternate perspective . \nplummer\'s character is the only one in the movie who\'s maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art , but even he\'s succumbed to the cult of manipulation . \nplummer\'s character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie . \nsome of jost vacano\'s cinematography is fantastic , and one particular delineation of nomi\'s character alteration , a no-dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting , is utterly terrifying . \nthis movie is rated nc-17 due to language , sexual situations , full frontal nudity , violence , and probably the costuming as well . \ni don\'t see a way this particular story could have been told well without it , and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie-making . \nbut don\'t go see it if you\'re not in a tough mood ; the only person it\'s possible to like in this movie ends up in an i . c . u . \non life support , and there is probably not one character in this movie you\'d enjoy meeting in person . \n'"
0,"b'isn\'t it the ultimate sign of a movie\'s cinematic ineptitude when you can\'t think of much to say about it other than "" it sucks "" ? \none of the first official year 2000 releases , supernova is such a movie . \ni can\'t seem to get past one-word adjectives with this one , although "" boring , "" "" stupid "" and "" absurd "" doesn\'t amount to much of a review . \na shame . \ni would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate . \nbut c\'est la vie . \nhere goes nothing . \ni\'ll keep it short . \ni suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill ( 48 hours ) removed his name from the movie , requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee . \nthe film\'s fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press , an event usually signifying a studio\'s lack of confidence in a particular movie . \nhill\'s and mgm\'s actions were prudent . \nwhen the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident , a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer , for some reason ( james spader ) is forced to take command . \nthe ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and , on arrival , picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony . \none of the crew members ( angela bassett ) knows this passenger , who is played by peter facinelli , and has some bad feelings about it -- and we all know what that means . \nthis intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo -- a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown , though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it . \nanother one of the crew members experiences this first hand ; after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo , he does some impressive handstand pushups . \nevidently , touching this enigmatic egg-shaped thingie makes you younger and stronger . \nhow ? \nwhy ? \nthe movie never bothers to explain . \nsoon enough though , spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad , being chased by the all-of-a-sudden-superhuman facinelli . \nto be honest , i don\'t even remember exactly why . \ni just remember that i didn\'t care . \nsupernova\'s plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas , such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb , but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything truly intriguing . \nin fact , everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set . \nwell , the effects are good , though there\'s hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so i\'m not sure whether that\'s so remarkable an accomplishment . \nthe performances are hardly worth talking about . \ni\'m not even sure i can call what\'s here "" performances , "" though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger . \njames spader is not a bad actor , but he proves to be one of the blandest action stars i\'ve seen in a while , mostly because he isn\'t given a character with a personality . \nthe action scenes are just as bland , since they\'re pretty much just rehashes of action elements that weren\'t particularly entertaining the first time around . \nand since the action scenes are everything to this movie , it\'s pretty much dead in the water . \nand for the life of me , i can\'t figure out why it\'s called supernova . \n'"

1,"b'contact ( pg ) there\'s a moment late in robert zemeckis\'s contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place . \nwe see a scientist , dressed in a silvery space suit , walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact , spherical space pod , unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops . \nanticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear--the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead . \nit is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment . \njodie foster stars as dr . ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals . \nand i mean life--after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie\'s world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth . \nafter dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport . \nfrom this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci-fi hook . \nthe alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe , but perhaps more than anything else , contact is a character study of ellie , whose obsession with empirical , scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power . \nthe irony is that , while admitting to having no religious faith , she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes , in a sense , a religion in its own right . \nit would be easy for scripters james v . hart and michael goldenberg , in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine , to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones , but they wisely eschew easy answers , giving equal time to both sides , and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane . \nin the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other , even slightly so--there are just two very viable points of view , each with their own merits , each with their own faults . \nthe complex role of ellie is an actress\'s dream , and foster , a virtual shoo-in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year , more than rises to the challenge . \nshe conveys intelligence , determination , warmth , and , in a gutsy move , always on edge . \nwe root for ellie and feel for her , but we also feel at times that she goes too far . \ncontact is clearly foster\'s vehicle , but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles . \nmatthew mcconaughey , who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role , holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie , spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss ( however , his main storyline , the tentative palmer-ellie romance , is the film\'s weakest subplot ) . \njohn hurt is effectively creepy as s . r . \nhadden , the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding . \nangela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine . \nmost memorable of all , though , are tom skerritt and james woods , who play rival scientist dr . david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz , respectively ; both , especially skerritt , embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances . \nzemeckis comes off of his three-year break in top shape . \nalways known as a director of effects-laden extravaganzas , it comes as no surprise that contact\'s visual effects are quite stunning . \nthe central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 : a space odyssey , but with more advanced technology at his disposal , zemeckis\'s voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick\'s yet more wondrously pure . \nand zemeckis doesn\'t resist the urge to use the always-interesting incorporate-actors-into-existing-film-footage effect , which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump . \neffects , however , are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama , emotion , and pure wonder , which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump . \nit says a lot that , in a summer science fiction film such as this , it\'s not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised . \nthe thought-provoking , two-hour-plus contact is a much-welcome change of pace from summer no-brainers , but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isn\'t entertaining . \nfor all the interesting questions it asks , the film is still what it\'s being sold as-- "" a journey to the heart of the universe . "" \nand what a fascinating , unforgettable journey it is . \n'"
0,"b'the most absurd remake of 1998 ? \nit\'s a toss up between gus van sant\'s psycho and mighty joe young , the new disney picture based on the old rko picture . \n ( i knew i was in trouble when a polished , computer-generated version of that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits . ) \nthere is no great demand for another giant ape movie-make that ape movie , period . \n ( witness the quick deaths of buddy , born to be wild and congo . ) \nand while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable , it\'s also an assembly line product through and through , lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it . \ntheron is jill young : as a young girl in the wilds of africa , she befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers . \nthat baby gorilla ( nicknamed joe ) grows to immense proportions , and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him , playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers . \nenter conservationist greg ( paxton ) , who convinces jill to move with joe to california , where they can protect him better in a controlled environment . \njoe is restless at first ; no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in l . a . , plotting joe\'s demise . \nsuffice it to say , the movie could have been called "" joe : ape in the city . "" \ntheron ( so good in devil\'s advocate ) and paxton ( so good in the recent a simple plan ) are fine actors , but not fine enough to transcend the material , a paint-by-numbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising . \nthe plot arguably borrows more from steven spielberg\'s the lost world than the 1949 original , with the computer-generated t-rex-i mean , joe-wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore ; the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third , with jill shouting , "" look , joe\'s headed for the movie theatre ! "" \nfollowed by a shot of joe scaling mann\'s chinese theater ; a moment later , jill shouts again something like "" look , joe\'s headed for an amusement park ! "" and what do you know , there\'s joe at the pallisades carnival , scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers . \nthe seams of last-minute edits to mighty joe young show-unrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves . \nthe movie sure feels uneven , regardless : act two is underdeveloped , while a little of joe smashing cars in act three goes a long , long way . \nunderwood ( tremors , speechless ) was perhaps not the director for the job ; even the plentiful , untamed landscape looks dull in his hands . \n ( capturing the beauty of nature requires more than his point and shoot style . ) \ni did enjoy certain sequences , especially the demoliton of a black-tie dinner sequence ; and the prologue , however implausible , is touching . \n ( as a tyke , joe acts just like e . t . ) rick baker\'s make-up effects and puppetry are outstanding , the real star of the show-yet , for all its technical flawlessness , the creature remains too grumpy and homicidal to love . \n ( his facial expressions are variations on a scowl . ) \nto be fair , i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed with wailing children-it\'s a wonder i was able to decipher the dialogue . \nit\'s certainly not a film for very young kids-intense fighting scenes may scare them , while any time joe\'s not on camera may bore them to tears . \n ( note : older boys are more likely to be dazzled by theron\'s colourful array of tank tops . ) \ni suspect bland mighty joe young is passable entertainment for a family outing , but they sure don\'t make ? em like they used to . \n'"
0,"b'when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects . \nwhile i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don\'t think that they are completely to blame for this movie\'s failure . \nit appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the "" unseen "" terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny . \nso special effects or not , if the story isn\'t the least bit scary , you aren\'t going to end up with a very frightening movie . \nthe thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern . \ndern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie . \nas i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern\'s caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast . \nnever a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie . \nliam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear . \nhe decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion . \nhe tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia . \nand he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on . \ncatherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects . \nlike the original , taylor\'s character is the star of the movie . \nbut since she doesn\'t quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms . zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original . \nand let\'s face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones . \ni\'ll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren\'t in it . \nbut the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets . \nthey take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients . \nthere really isn\'t much of a story here . \njust endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with . \nand the special effects are great . \nin many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere . \nin other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the "" cool shots "" quota . \nat no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe . \nbut not scary . \nthen we have the set . \nwhen i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it . \nbut it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route . \nthis included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves . \nwhat part did these rooms play in the story ? \nabsolutely none . \nthey were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie . \nthen we have the actors . \nlili taylor has never been one of my favorites . \nand when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark . \ni have no idea why liam neeson took this role . \nhe basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus . \nhis character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him . \ni have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman . \nzeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words . \nthe fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake . \nall catherine has to do in this movie is look good . \nfortunately that is something she does very well . \nwhile she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye-candy . \nit\'s too bad someone of her talents wasted them here . \nany random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role . \nthe haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999\'s horror movies , the blair witch project . \nthe haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares . \nboth prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film . \nif the story sucks , it\'s all downhill from there . \nmy advice ? \nif you are looking for special effects , go rent star wars . \nif it\'s scares you want , rent halloween . \neither way , it\'s probably in your best interests to skip the haunting . \n'"
1,"b""earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent . \npeople who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee . \nthe story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves . \nthe action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta . \nshanta has a small circle of male admirers . \ntwo of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim . \nthe others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das . \n ( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water . ) \nin an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears . \none of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along . \nhe is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism . \nthe tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses . \nit is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter . \nthe group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together . \nbut the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state . \na sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees . \nanother man is murdered . \nthe group of friends will not meet again . \nthe movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles . \nit is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully . \nthe crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz . \nhis sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim . \ndil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him . \nbut she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer . \nthe combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate . \ndespite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things . \nthe conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt . \nthe story earth tells does not end . \nit just stops . \nit is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction . \nbut there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades . \nsince the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus . \nthere is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story ) . \nearth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie . \nit does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas . \nbut deepa mehta's directon is assured , and the issues she addresses run deep . \nearth does for india what movies like zhang yimou's to live and tian zhuangzhuang's the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history . \nsuch films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed . \nthey may be biased or inaccurate , but they bear the weight of human hardship , and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other , more inventive films , often lack . \nit is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries : the events shown may have happened decades ago , but they still touch a nerve . \nthe issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year . \nin the near future , india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other . \nat the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen ; after seeing earth , i have a much , much better understanding . \n"""
1,"b'with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable . \nin fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer . \nhanding over the director\'s chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions . \ninstead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture . \nwhat results is one of the most terrifying films ever created . \na film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it . \ni never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have . \nthe terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear . \naliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen . \nwith a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film . \nin fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original . \nperhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be . \nnever have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character . \nsigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about . \nplacing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver\'s presence , a woman is the only suitable hero . \naliens begins 57 years after alien ended . \nlieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened . \nshe explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but "" the company "" is doubtful . \nthey explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left . \ndespite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won\'t call the families back . \nhowever , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley\'s story seems much more feasible . \none of the company\'s directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet . \nthis team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen ) . \nburke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony . \narriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment . \nthe only survivor is 12 year old rebecca "" newt "" jorden ( carrie henn ) . \nripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt\'s surrogate mother . \nripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose . \naliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott\'s version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general . \nalien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo . \naliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens , and as a result , the chills are incredibly heightened . \nthen again , this is james cameron , the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 : judgment day . \nhe is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin , who directed cliffhanger ) , and only he could create something as terrifying as this film . \nit seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes , and aliens has the motherload . \nwith perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film , aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion . \ni can\'t recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout , never dropping for a moment . \njust when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again . \nwith a seemingly endless conclusion , aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history . \nthis scene is usually the one remembered most from the film , as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen . \nusing flawless special effects , the climax is exhausting , leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety . \nof course , for a film of this genre to work properly , the technical

terrifying alien to go with them . \none of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music , composed by cameron-regular james horner . \nhorner has created a terrific score , receiving an oscar nomination for his work . \nnot only that , horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film , or science fiction film ever ( and that includes 2001 : a space odyssey , which was mainly a compilation of well-known composers ) . \nin fact , the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music . \nthe production design is incredible , which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy . \ndark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive , but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well-lit locations . \nnormally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer ; aliens uses lights to scare the viewer . \nthen , of course , is the cinematography , which uses point of view shots , along with video feeds in order to build suspense . \nsome of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley . \nsurprisingly , the acting is not only above average for this genre , but some of the best . \nsigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley , incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard-edged persona . \nweaver soars above the rest in this film , but she is supposed to . \ncarrie henn gives an above average performance for a child , developing a three-dimensional character from her quiet attitude . \nlance henriksen is terrific as bishop , showing that androids don\'t always have to be flat characters . \njenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role , and steals several scenes of her own ( though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn\'t fighting ) . \nmichael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film . \nhowever , biehn does a good job , making it seem original again . \npaul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director , but reiser manages to pull it off quite well ( however , i still see him as paul on tv\'s "" mad about you "" ) . \na very good cast ( which also includes bill paxton and william hope ) highlights this action film , making it stand out from others . \naliens is rightfully rated r for violence , gore , language , and terror . \naliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre , as alien was more of a suspense/horror film . \naliens pumps up the stakes , and cameron directs it with professional quality . \ncameron certainly knows how to make a good action film , but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen . \ntechnically astonishing , aliens\' only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed . \naside from this , you probably won\'t experience anything like aliens for quite a while . \n'"

0,"b'one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director sidney lumet\'s "" gloria , "" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre . \nsuddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in . \nwhen a movie is over , aren\'t we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ? \ni thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn\'t have been anything to talk about in the first place . \nto be sure , "" gloria "" begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy\'s family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it . \nright before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with . \neventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment . \nmeanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn\'t commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime . \nwhen he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude . \ngloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don\'t they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with . \nthe previous incarnation of "" gloria "" by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can\'t really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars . \nthere is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn\'t completely unbearable to watch . \ni liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again . \nthese bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers . \nthroughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , "" who really cares ? "" \nas gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn\'t sound realistic at all . \nin the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone\'s performance was , but as the film progressed she got better . \nalthough not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored . \njean-luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag . \nall other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria\'s friend whom she turns to for help . \nsony , the studio that released "" gloria , "" obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don\'t blame them . \nthey declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high-profile people involved . \nalthough how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular "" in dreams , "" which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion "" gloria "" is going to vanish from theaters faster than "" ishtar , "" judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself . \nalthough stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995\'s "" casino "" or 1996\'s "" last dance "" if you don\'t believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of "" gloria "" was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful . \n'"

1,"b'the 1990s produced two brilliant science fiction films . \none was _gattaca_ . \nthe other was _the thirteenth floor_ . \njust as _gattaca_ was overshadowed by the mighty _titanic_ , _the thirteenth floor_ was relegated to obscurity by _the matrix_ . \nhowever , _the thirteeth floor_ , though it deals with similar themes , is a much better movie than the frenetic , childish and improbable _matrix_ . \na cutting edge computer scientist , hannon fuller ( played by the charming armin mueller-stahl ) , is murdered . \nhis associate , douglas hall , ( craig bierko ) apparently framed and suspected by the police , enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery . \nalong the way a beautiful blonde ( gretchen mol ) , more bodies , and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture . \n_the thirteenth floor_ unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches , choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise . \nthe result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view . \nfirst , its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline . \nsecond and more seriously , it demands that its audience think and feel . \nno wonder it fell through the cracks . \ndone in film noir style as a murder mystery , this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels . \nmany audiences will simply be bewildered by it , rather than engaged , which is a shame , because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment . \ni recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie . \ndespite its philosophical challenges , _the thirteenth floor_ derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller ( mol ) and douglas hall ( bierko ) , as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller . \nin that sense it is more akin to _gattaca_ than _the matrix_ , which , for all of its cute philosophical byplay , is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever . \nthe moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying , wrenching and intellectually challenging . \nin its final moments the film even takes on itself , when david , jane\'s husband , who has come to enjoy killing , accuses her of being the sick one . \nalthough there is a victory for the leading characters , this resolution suggests a disturbing element of fantasy in jane , and thus a deep-seated character flaw . \nin fact , hannon fuller\'s activities in the simulated world , the behavior of jane\'s husband , and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters . \nthis is not a film of good people beset from without by great evil . \nthe tragedy is not in their stars , but in themselves . \nthe major actors , all of whom are required to play two or even three roles , perform extremely well . \nbierko , who will be familiar as the psycho from _the long kiss goodnight_ , is outstanding . \nd\'onofrio as whitney , who plays a pivotal role in support , also turns in a good performance . \nthe lovely gretchen mol , whose elegance , integrity , and determination suggest bergman in _casablanca_ , does a wonderful job . \nher voice , however , lacks the necessary weight at times . \nthis could be because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is the script . \nsome minor flaws , hairline cracks in fine porcelain , appear in places . \nthere are one or two instances of jerky editing . \nthe script takes the edge off the film\'s climaxes . \nthe atmosphere becomes too claustrophobic at times ( yet , there is a clue there too ) . \none wonders if even after two decades , _blade runner_ is still casting its long shadow over sci-fi films . \none can see a group of suits in their suite , waving their hands imperiously at directors like the emperor in _amadeus_ : "" make it more like_blade runner_ , you know , dark and rainy .

0,"b'another formula \'feel good\' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like "" waking ned devine , "" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . \nit is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . \nthe strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . \nthe film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . \nbut its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . \nits message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the \'war on drugs\' is about to be escalated into colombia . \nthe drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america\'s jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america\'s drug usage and drug supply . \nbillions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . \neverything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . \nthe film\'s mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . \nthere has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . \nthe film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . \nthe widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . \nhe left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . \nthe widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband\'s enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . \nshe also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . \nwhat makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . \neven though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . \nher gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . \nsince she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . \nthe two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . \nfor grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . \nthe locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace\'s greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can\'t control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . \nthe story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn\'t want matthew to end up in jail . \nit is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . \nthe scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . \nthe film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . \nthings work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . \nthere are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . \nthis \'unhip\' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . \nummm !

1,"b'david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director . \nwith his distinctive , more often than not ingenious dialogue , and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible . \nsome of them tend to be thickly layered , deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message , or sometimes even a concealed storyline . \nand although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors , it is still a brilliantly complex , consistently riveting motion picture about honor , about sacrifice , and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right . \noh , and it\'s rated g . \nincidentally , this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else\'s work ; namely a play by terrence rattigan , set in the 19th century . \nhe casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow , a rich , aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note . \n "" did you do it ?

1,"b'bill condon\'s "" gods and monsters "" is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classics "" frankenstein "" and "" bride of frankenstein . "" \nsince i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale\'s inner fantasies and hallucinations . \nwhale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him . \nas the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l . a . , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home . \njames whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , "" a dirty old man . "" \nin one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale\'s home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing . \nbecause of this episode , we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting , later making the excuse that his bright , white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off . \nclayon agrees , and doesn\'t really think much of this , much to the warnings of his friends , becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past . \ncertainly , the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall , since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boone is not gay , and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life , as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis . \n "" gods and monsters "" is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual preference , and never got the recognition he would have liked , since he longed to be referred to as a "" motion picture director , "" rather than a "" horror director . "" \nand in one heartbreaking scene , he attends a party with boone being his guest , held by director george cuckor , and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore . \nit is evident that whale\'s first love in his life was making movies , and when his career ultimately fell apart , so did his passion in life . \nas played brilliantly by ian mckellen , james whale comes off as a sad , but dignified man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others , just as long as he knew he was being true to himself . \nhe never hid the fact that he was gay , however , even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession , and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person . \nthrough the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone , boone , of course , only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to , while it means so much more to whale , who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life . \nalthough boone is only in a dead-end job as a gardener of people\'s homes , whale views him as the ideal man , not only one that is good-looking , even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings , but one that will actually listen to him . \nsince whale lives with only his loyal , but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) , it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world , and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor . \nalthough an extremely fine and mature picture , a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness . \nit is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments , but it is a little thin , and the structuring of the "" on-again-off-again "" friendship at the film\'s center is fairly predictable . \nwe know early on where these two characters are headed , and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds . \nin lesser hands , this set-up might have felt too calculated , but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this . \nalso , a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar ( effectively played by lolita davidovich ) , but abruptly dropped and never brought up again . \nif the film was not going to follow up on this side story , then it , perhaps , should have been taken out altogether . \n "" gods and monsters "" is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture , impressively directed by bill condon , who , i sense , relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone . \nthe film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end . \nwalking away from "" gods and monsters , "" it was ian mckellen\'s marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me , and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably . \nit is a sad testament when a person\'s true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them , based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life , which , ironically enough , is no one else\'s business in the first place . \n'"

1,"b'brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly . \nsince scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 , depalma has seen casualties of war , raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames . \nconsequently , it would be easy enough to consider carlito\'s way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma , reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes . \nit doesn\'t hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn . \ncarlito\'s way , while hampered by depalma\'s characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama . \ncarlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life-long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance . \nin 1975 , carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality . \nhe declares himself reformed , tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas . \namong those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn ) , carlito\'s crooked attorney and childhood friend , and bodyguard pachanga ( luis guzman ) . \ncarlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller ) , and seems ready to retire in peace . \nold ways die hard , though , and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can\'t seem to shake . \ncarlito\'s way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film . \nin the first , carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat ; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station . \nboth highlight depalma\'s gift for choreographed mayhem , and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely . \nyet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling . \ncarlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him , an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit . \nbut where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there\'s more of an immediacy to carlito\'s way , an ever-present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion . \nyou sense that there\'s no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble . \nindeed , he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart : "" you don\'t get reformed ; you just run out of wind . "" \npacino captures carlito\'s dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy . \nsean penn is even better , turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld . \na jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys , kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder . \nhe could have been simply pathetic , a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league , but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct . \nhe shows a man moving steadily towards the brink , making the moment he goes over quite jolting . \nas compelling as the narrative is , viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu . \ndepalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors , this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas . \nhe even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables . \nfrom a story standpoint , there\'s an obligatory love story with a cliche\'d long-suffering girlfriend character . \npenelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn\'t do anything new with the role , and eventually she becomes just a distraction , never integrated fully enough into the story . \nstill , it\'s easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid . \nthe two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention , one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn\'t break . \ncarlito\'s way plays like a tragic novel : deliberate , confident and powerful . \nthose willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well- rewarded . \n'"
1,"b'seen july 8 , 1998 at the crossgates cinema 18 , ( albany , ny ) , theater #7 , at 8 : 15 p . m . with my mom using hoyts cinema cash . \n[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] \nit\'s very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic , vivid sense of reality and life . \nall stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters\' lives , but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do . \ntherefore , "" gone with the wind "" deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does , in such a crafted , intricate , and entertaining manner . \nit\'s a crowning achievement , not only in filmmaking , but for storytelling itself . \nthe film takes place in georgia before , during , and after the civil war . \nthis plays a major factor in the film\'s success . \nto use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy . \nit might also seem cliche , boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers . \ncan a story set so long ago be relatable now ? \nthe film confronts all these problems , paradoxically , by not cronfronting them . \nit doesn\'t simply plug in the "" right thing "" at the "" right time , "" it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant . \nbuilding a strong foundation is important to all forms of media , without which , what is there to build on ? \nwe\'re given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters , especially our main character , scarlett o\'hara ( leigh ) , a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel , a cunning wit , and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time . \nshe knows how her society works , wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her . \nright from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be . \nbeing the most sought-after woman allows her to manipulate men ( and their women ) to ensure she gets her way , whether it be obvious ( i . e . \nwho will be the one to get her food ) , or subtle ( i . e . \ngetting married just to spite someone ) . \nthe man she claims to love is ashley wilkes ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him . \nhe isn\'t so arrogant and demanding as scarlett , in fact , he\'s engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his . \nher name is melanie ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likable characters one will ever see . \nshe and scarlett become very dear friends , but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband . \nher meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is , but doesn\'t give her much emotional self-defense . \nacting a catalyst to the love triangle , and to the story as a whole is the daper , stong-willed , cunning , cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler ( gable ) . \nhe\'s quite a character all right - everyone listens to what he has to say even though he\'s got a bad reputation . \nbutler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior . \nhe tells everyone the much-needed truth in the rigid caste-like society where freewill doesn\'t seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition . \nfor example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there\'s no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out . \nthis angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that . \n "" do we have ammunition factories ? \ndo we have food ? \ndo we have a navy ? \nall we have is tobacco . "" \nall true statements and yet the south still insists he\'s wrong . \nbutler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it\'s appealing . \nscarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her , we know he\'s not going to stop until he has her . \nbut scarlett can\'t get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever . \nand so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life . \nthe conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is "" marked "" for life when her first husband dies . \nthis gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story . \nsome are vital for only a few scenes , but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film . \nin most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance . \neven people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set . \nthe costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place . \nthe filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside , real world , but these types of simple approaches are never taken . \nthe first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war . \nfleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is . \none scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming , "" no ! \nnot my leg ! \ndon\'t cut off my leg ! "" \nanother scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street , but as the camera pulls back , we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers , but it is their moaning that\'s more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be . \nas the second half begins , the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single-handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north . \nshe manages to resurrect the family plantation , but all the willpower she has can\'t help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south\'s ultimate defeat . \nthis brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship . \nmost of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett . \neach uses the other for personal gain , but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other . \nscarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can\'t help but want her more every time she tries to one-up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business . \nthey say opposites attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities , it borders on magnetic polarization . \nthey need each other and know this , yet they never seem truly happy together . \nperhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call . \nboth have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other . \nlove and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film , we\'re left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why . \ngable and leigh do have great chemistry , always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture . \nall ? \nnone ? \neither way is possible and it\'s a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings . \nit\'s safe to say most of us won\'t live such overly dramatic lives as those in "" gone with the wind , "" but it\'s still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we\'ve just experienced a life\'s worth of joy and pain . \n'"

\nexcuse me , again , while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion . \neve marks ( meg ryan ) is the middle mozzell sister , still living in the california town where she grew up , and with a husband ( adam arkin ) and pre-teen son ( jesse james ) . \nher elderly , wisecracking father , lou ( walter matthau , in his brightest performance in years ) has just recently been put into the hospital , in the final stages of what i assume is alzheimer\'s ( even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him ) . \nwhile eve\'s relationship with her mother ( cloris leachman ) is nearly nonexistent , since she ran out on lou and her children years ago , she has had her fair share of up\'s and down\'s with lou , who used to be an alcoholic . \nher older sister is georgia ( diane keaton ) , an editor for the self-titled magazine , "" georgia , "" while maddy ( lisa kudrow ) is the youngest , a soap opera actress . \ninterestingly , their professions are given , but we not once ever see them working at their jobs , or , for that matter , learn much of anything about them . \nmaddy , georgia , and eve do not see each other much anymore , their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart , but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another . \nand they talk . \nand talk . \nand talk . . . \nin fact , the telephone is the major star of the film , even more so than ryan , as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92-minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long . \nif you are able to get through the opening half-hour , in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them , you will surely survive the rest . \nthe question is , who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating , self-involved pat-on-the-back ? \nhow could a comedy-drama that has the star-power of meg ryan , lisa kudrow , and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways ? \nissues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up , but the film isn\'t mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner , and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood , it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought . \nalso , it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another , but no dynamic metamorphosizes . \nand when they do reunite in the finale , their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three-minute scene in which they argue like little children . \nyou can see the impending death coming a mile away , and it conveniently occurs in the next scene , so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves , and with each other . \nyou think to yourself : "" the only thing left for them to do is have a playful food-fight , "" and like clockwork , it also occurs by the end credits . \nmeg ryan is a versatile actress ( look no further than 1998\'s "" hurlyburly "" or 1994\'s "" when a man loves a woman "" ) , despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies . \nwith "" hanging up , "" the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron , a writer/director/hack who shouldn\'t be allowed to work in hollywood again after this big-budget , high-profile debacle . \neven if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department , she nonetheless is very good , and the two scenes that work , flashbacks to christmas 1988 , when she had a heartbreaking run-in with her mother , and to halloween 1993 , when lou crashed her son\'s birthday party in a drunken stupor , are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations . \ndiane keaton , as georgia , is better as an actress than a director here , but that is a wildly feeble compliment . \nwhat is more than a little far-fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow , although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children , she is no more than five years ryan\'s senior . \nyeah , right . \nlastly , poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in a big-screen venture , after her even more thin role in 1999\'s "" analyze this .

"" \nand to top it all off , in the inevitable climax set at the prom , at least we didn\'t have to once again suffer through a goofy , inappropriate dance sequence ( who could forget , or want to remember , for that matter , this ludicrous development in "" she\'s all that ? "" ) . \nthe day wide-eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon-levitt ) starts school at seattle-based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) . \nalthough he doesn\'t know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won\'t allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to . \nkat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . \ncomplicating matters , cameron\'s dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey . \nas you can see , "" 10 things i hate about you "" includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven\'t even mentioned , such as kat\'s shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca\'s materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) . \nat a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of "" she\'s all that , "" where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , "" you\'re vapor "" ) . \nsince i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained . \naside from a good screenplay , it\'s the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot . \naside from joseph gordon-levitt ( "" 3rd rock from the sun "" ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well-known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings . \nas the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries "" the \'60s "" ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her . \neven though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged , it was easy to identify with kat\'s way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality . \nno one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does . \nheath ledger , as the infamous bad-boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles . \none other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi-dimensions , even though she is accurately self-centered at the on-set . \nin one truthful scene , cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish , and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes , she has . \none off-beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school\'s staff act , which is strikingly unformal . \nallison janney , as the guidance counselor ms . perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl "" chill "" mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good . \nalthough there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters . \nin one very funny scene , chastity asks , "" i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be . . . whelmed ? "" \nat another point , bianca and kat\'s father ( a stand-out larry miller ) , who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant , only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion : before she leaves , she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it\'s like to be pregnant . \n "" 10 things i hate about you "" once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre , and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the \'90s . \nit also helps that the movie has a perfectly-assembled soundtrack , mixing indie-rock with new wave \'80s songs ( and with , thank goodness , no rap ) . \nby the film\'s end , it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together , and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up , especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca , kat and her father , and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class ( this is where the title comes from ) . \nluckily , i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about "" 10 things i hate about you , "" but the positive aspects of the film far out-number ten . \n'"

0,"b'the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer\'s other comic book adaptation , batman and robin . \nboth films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts , but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty-headed character motivations . \nin panel-sized morsels , implausible plots and "" rambo "" -esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork , but on thirty foot silver screens , it\'s much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures . \nspawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons ( white ) who is framed by a corporate baddie ( played without irony by sheen ) , then set on fire and left for dead . \nthough the movie skimps on the next few plot points , here\'s what i could determine : said assassin then becomes the leader of satan\'s army , under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown ( leguizamo , grating as always ) . \nhe is renamed , for reasons unbeknownst , spawn , and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon . \nbut when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child , he realizes that he can\'t be the evil superdemon he\'s expected to be , and he sets about avenging his untimely death . \ntypical of summer blockbusters , spawn is an effects-laden ninety minute rock video . \nwhile the visions of hell are laughably crude ( think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man ) , spawn\'s prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold . \nbut the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion ( spawn longs for his wife , but they don\'t have a single scene together before simmons\' death ! ) , conflict ( who will triumph is not anybody\'s guess ) , and believability ( not that i expected it ) . \nso many questions are left unanswered , and i\'m sure they won\'t be addressed in the inevitable sequel . \nwhile last year\'s the crow : city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative ( which was lazy and somewhat incoherent ) , it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power . \nspawn is an in-your-face , screaming banshee of a film ; these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid , but they haven\'t the faintest idea how to make a movie . \n'"
1,"b'call it touched by a demon . \ngregory hoblit\'s fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist . \nif marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . \nin fact , there\'s even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion\'s share of the weirdness distilled out . \n ( remember bob ? ) \nthe biggest failing of fallen is that , although it\'s consistently interesting , it\'s not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . \na serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . \nnow , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , "" what goes around really goes around . "" \nshortly thereafter , he begins to sing "" time is on my side "" as he\'s taken on his last walk . \nminutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . \nbut for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn\'t a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . \nand , with reese\'s death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will . \nonly hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they\'re up against . \nthe rest of the cops , including hobbes\' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don\'t have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger . \nas depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one . \nno skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . \nthe most famous landmark to appear isn\'t the liberty bell or independence hall ; it\'s geno\'s steaks . \nshadows and night scenes abound . \nthe days are cloudy and unpromising . \nthis is the kind of setting where it\'s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . \nfallen\'s plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . \nsomehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . \nbut the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . \nnevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . \nthe film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . \nof the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . \njohn goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . \nsadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . \neveryone else , including denzel washington , is boring . \nwashington\'s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . \nit\'s not that he\'s bad per se , but he\'s not very interesting . \nthere\'s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . \nas circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . \nwashington\'s subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . \nhowever , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler\'s list ) and donald sutherland . \nto be fair , the flaws in their characters aren\'t all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . \nthat said , however , there\'s nothing inspired about either davidtz\'s or sutherland\'s work . \nboth appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . \nnarratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . \nalthough the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . \nat times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like "" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself "" become a little hard to swallow . \nin addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . \nhowever , despite the negatives , i\'m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . \nthe final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . \nit\'s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . \nat a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . \nthis is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it\'s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . \nand , whatever you do , don\'t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll . \n'"

"" \nhowever , even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes . \nhollywood is just another example , with its revisionist westerns , made in early 1990s . \nthose movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness , coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus\' discovery of america . \none of such examples is geronimo : an american legend , 1993 western directed by walter hill , film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers . \nthe hero of the film is geronimo ( played by wes studi ) , leader of apaches , fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century . \nwhen the movie begins , in 1885 , geronimo and his apaches made peace with u . s . government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation . \nhowever , broken promises , injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless . \nwith not more 30 or so of his followers , he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign . \ngeneral crook ( gene hackman ) , commander of u . s . army forces , respects geronimo and knows that even his 5 , 000 force isn\'t enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest . \ninstead , he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches - lt . charles gatewood ( jason patric ) and indian hunter al sieber ( robert duvall ) . \ntogether with young lt . britton davis ( matt damon ) they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo . \ngeronimo : an american legend , like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness , try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities , but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors . \nso , the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies . \nalmost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people . \nalthough such elements of john millius\' screenplay do indeed have some basis in history , they harm the story of geronimo . \nto be honest , walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film , but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time . \ninstead , they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band . \nto make even worse , hill has some real problems with pacing and style , and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one - story about geronimo and story about his pursuers . \nthe movie should have been better if it turned to geronimo\'s life before and after his last uprising , in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood . \nthe difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting . \nwes studi , cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans , was perfect choice for geronimo , not only because he resembles geronimo , but because he induces a lot of passion in his role . \ncontrary to him , we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies . \nwhile this could be expected from someone like jason patric , it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall . \neven hill\'s directing is bellow expectations - battle scenes are too short and , like in many of his late films , force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 1970s . \neven his old associate , music composer ry cooder , disappoints , with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic . \non the other hand , photography by lloyd ahern ii , with the use of red lenses , gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere , ideal for this movie that was supposed to be melancholic epic . \nall in all , compared with some of the hollywood\'s examples of political correctness , this film isn\'t so bad , but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better . \n'"

0,"b'this is an adaptation of h . g . wells\' acclaimed novel \'the invisible man\' . \nthe actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue . \nthe director is paul verhoven . \nthat , plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer , should be enough to lure us into the theatre . \nthe problem is to keep us there . \ni can\'t imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time . \nworking on a top secret military project , sebastian caine ( kevin beacon ) -- an eccentric genius , that calls himself "" god "" , has discovered the secret to invisibility . \nthe first two faces are completed . \nnow , it is time for "" the next logical step "" -- human . \ncaine volunteers for this risky experiment . \nbut when he is made invisible , something goes wrong . \nwhile his ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower . \nbut that\'s not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania . \nhe is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine . \nsoon every sense of decency is forgotten . \nthe little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien-rip-off , where caine is walking like a half finished terminator , spooking , scaring and killing everybody . \nthough it\'s based on a novel called \'the invisible man\' , the title has been ironically changed to \'hollow man\' that sums up the film very nicely . \nthis is a very silly production . \nlaughable , actually . \napparently verhoven\'s imagination doesn\'t stretch too far . \nfor him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls\' locker room undetected . \nit is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie . \nbeing invisible , gives you the opportunity to be who you are , to do what you want without being influenced by society . \nin many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences . \nthe nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about . \nall that , the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat . \ncaine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man . \nbut since this is a modernization , in other words a dehumanization , he doesn\'t stop there . \nhe becomes a rapist . \nand then , of course , a murderer . \nyou\'ll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place . \nshue\'s talent is barely seen , josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent . \nkevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully . \nhis face is not seen for the most part of the film , and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice . \nthere are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing . \nin the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place . \nbeing probably the best technical achievement since "" jurassic park "" , they are absolutely amazing . \nwe observe the layers of skin , muscle , tissue , and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible . \nwe see a beating heart , inflating lungs , and veins pulsing with newly-pumped blood . \nthere are a couple of inventive shots with smoke , fire , air and water , but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for ? \nwhat is truly disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget , this could have been so much more . \npretty much like jan de bont ( "" twister "" , "" haunting "" ) , paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary . \nhe was responsible for several good films ( "" basic instinct "" and "" starship troopers ) "" and some incredibly bad films ( "" showgirls "" , "" total recall "" ) , but he has never made anything that was great . \nin a way "" hollow man "" fits perfectly in this collection . \nit\'s not better or worse than verhoven\'s average film . \nhe proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues . \nand so , instead of depth and chills , verhoven inserts some of his trademarks : stupid dialogue , and lot\'s of dull action with blood and naked bodies . \nhe even throws in some of the worst of film clich ? s - the slowly advancing fireball , the villain who comes back from the dead , etc , etc . - and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year ( you\'ll be screaming "" nooooo ! "" \nand attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion ) . \nand all we can ask is why ? \nthe answer is simple . \nthough hollywood is a movie producing machine , the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money . \nit has to be about telling stories , not marketing them . \nit has to be about transporting us to a different place , to dazzle us with magic and cleverness . \nto make us care , to make us think and feel . \nverhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that . \nit\'s all flesh and bones , but no soul . \na void where its imagination should be . \n'"

1,"b""just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) . \neither way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny . \nwhy is this ? \nmaybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional . \ndirector stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day . \nwhen watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again . \ni laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends . \ni laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time . \nand i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around . \nrob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all . \nhe uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman . \nand like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort . \nhe spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it . \nwhatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co . \ngrasp them and help fill voids in their social lives . \nrob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in . \nduring this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him . \nbut these aren't any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) . \nthe plot in three words is : women and music . \nthe approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective . \nit gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle . \nit also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is . \njack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball . \njust listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week . \nwhat frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes . \njohn cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob . \nnow instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say . \nthe only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended . \ninstead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that . \nalso bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie . \nhigh fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs . \ni just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great . \n"""

only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants . \ntaran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king\'s castle from far away . \ntaran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen . \nhe manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon . \nthere , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls . \nalong the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie . \nthe three manage to escape the horned king\'s castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic . \nas they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen\'s trail . \nhe leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks\' , to a whirlpool . \nsuddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk . \ntaran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva . \nhe then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world . \nwith the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage . \nit turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place . \nwhen taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword . \ntaran agrees , much to eilonwy\'s horror , but at least they get the black cauldron . \nbut ? the cauldron can\'t be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped . \nthe only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive . \nthings take a turn for the worse when the horned king\'s henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle . \ntaran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? ) . \njust when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr . \ntaran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away . \ngurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay . \ntaran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king . \nhe kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely . \ntaran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king\'s castle just as it self-destructs . \nthe witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain\' . \nin response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi . \nthe trade is made ; gurgi\'s seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group . \nas taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs-he is not dead after all ! \nthe happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return . \nas spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times . \nbefore ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio . \nbringing this book to the screen was the studio\'s fondest dream . \nmiller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects . \nwhen micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron . \nby this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department . \nmany of the studio\'s old men had retired or died . \ntherefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film . \noriginally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped . \nthe film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied\' from lloyd alexander\'s chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney\'s other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it . \nin addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart\' and `unmemorable\' , compared to other disney animated features . \nbut whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million . \nthe failure of the film grounded the studio\'s animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio\'s reputation . \nthe next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn\'t do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective ) . \nonly with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features . \nas for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron . \nfinally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released . \nbecause of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ? \nthe people who had seen the film didn\'t think so . \nin fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it . \nfor a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom . \nfew people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn\'t seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat . \nbut people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) . \nsomewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , `bring back the black cauldron ! \' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states . \nbefore that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs . \nthose rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version . \neven still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed . \nsome felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn\'t . \nbut these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available . \nas for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i didn\'t expect much at all . \nin fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i didn\'t think the film would ever be such a good film . \nmuch to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , "" this is the same film everyone saw ? \nthe one that flopped at the box office ? \nthe one that critics and filmgoers alike called "" a bad movie "" ? \nthis doesn\'t seem like all of the above . \ninstead , it\'s a classic in its own right . \nthe film has a wonderful cast of characters . \nthere\'s taran ( grant bardsley ) , an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig-keeper , the story\'s hero . \nthe critics have said that taran is not likeable at all , but the opposite is true . \nhe is brave , loyal , and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on . \nthere\'s a likeable character here ! \nnot that he\'s the only likeable character in the film . \nthere\'s gurgi ( john biner ) , a lovable little , uh , thing who remains loyal to taran , even though they don\'t quite hit it off at first . \nbut another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film\'s imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck . \nthe other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren\'t quite as well rounded as they should be . \nthe story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale . \nelmer bernstein\'s music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner . \nthe animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios . \neven though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good , like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth , the animation overall is top notch . \noverall ? this film is an entertaining endeavor . \nfans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one , except young kids . \nthere are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney\'s other films ( although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary ) , which is the main reason why this film is rated pg . \nfans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie . \neven though it doesn\'t have all of the ingredients of a true disney film , this film is a classic in its own right , and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given . \nthat better chance has finally come . \nwhatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared , and the film has finally achieved its place among disney\'s most proudest achievements . \ni can\'t help but think though , whatever would have happened if the black cauldron * was * a box office success ?

0,"b'starring ben stiller , elizabeth hurley , maria bello , janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz , based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz \npermanent midnight is a pretty bad movie , though it took me a few days to conclude this . \nthe film is more masturbatory than bleak , with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity . \n ( he has a $6000 a week drug habit . ) \nultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are less mystified by his self-destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself . \nben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l . a . with ambition and a nasty drug habit . \nhe eventually gets a gig for $5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr . chompers ( a thinly veiled stand-in for "" alf "" : chompers looks just like alf except he\'s blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spanish mother ( liz torres ) , who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons . \ninsert proverbial downward spiral here . \npermanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback , with recovering addict bello meeting stiller ( at a fastfood restaurant , where stiller works the drive-thru as part of rehab ) , taking him back to a hotel , and between bouts of serious screwing , listening to his life story . \ni\'ve spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive-worse , i\'ve been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive . \nas stahl , stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect ( post-there\'s something about mary ) of either the actor or a comedy writer . \nwhat separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk-junkies , it seems , is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy . \nwatch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby ! \nwatch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack-fueled babble ! \nstiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie . \nbut permanent midnight is mostly soulless . \nwhen the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ? \nand then answers it in the form of bello\'s character ( basically a shrink in black panties ) , could a person care less ? \nin the film version of his autobiography of the same name , stahl doesn\'t need saving , he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself . \nif you learn anything about the other characters in this movie , it\'s that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood-types known to man . \n ( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs . \nis this hollywood . . . california ? ) \ni learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead . \nof course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems . \nso , basically , his drug habit got him a book deal , a movie based on his life , and now he\'s apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects . \nso much for the moral of that story . \ntemporary midnight is more like it . \n-bill chambers ; september , 1998 \n'"

1,"b'capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp . \nto end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity . \nthe somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone\'s taste . \n , +3 ( -4 to +4 ) \nmore than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way . \nthis may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law . \nduring world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war . \nthis led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal . \nwhen the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal . \nminimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output . \nwhile the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27% . \nthe best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad . \nthat railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do . \nthe best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day . \nand just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll . \nin the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany . \nfilmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese . \nthere are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps . \ncertainly there was david lean\'s the bridge on the river kwai . \nthere were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it . \nthen there were tv series "" a town like alice "" and "" tenko . "" \nlest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa . \nit is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university . \nthe film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them . \nthe story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad . \nit turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves . \nbeating and torture are commonplace events . \nmen already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable . \nhowever , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house . \nso goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying machine . \nthis is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies . \nthe japanese believe that the individual is nothing , that conformity to group\'s norms is all that gives a life meaning . \nconformity is purpose . \nbefore the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp . \nif this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story . \nif the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story . \nit is neither . \nit is a stirring and believable account of camp life . \nthe color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow . \nthis serves a double purpose for cunningham . \nit gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat . \nit also creates a distancing effect . \nthe only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music . \nthis is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience . \ni rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n'"

1,"b'probably the most popular and praised film of all time , turned out to be a primitive and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism . \neveryone knows about the greatest and most famous shipping disaster of all time . \nand the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted by director james cameron , combining visual -and sound effects , he re-creates the frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship in the middle of nowhere . \ni liked very much the emotional and brutal contrast between the first and the third classes . \nwhile their cabin is slowly filling up with water , a mother is telling her children a fairytail -- "" . . and \nthey lived happily ever after . . "" . \nand then the ship goes down and the few survivors are left alone under the stars and the chilling air . \nhowever , the actual disaster is happening almost at the end of the movie , while the first two hours are just beautiful sets and bad dialogues . \nin the present day , the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett ( bill paxton ) , a treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond , lost during the sinking . \nsomewhere inside the ship , lovett\'s crew discover a sketchbook of an artist long dead . \nhere , in the shape of a nude young lady , is a window into the distant age of 1912 . \nlovett is extremely surprised when he get\'s a phone call from rose dawson , claiming that she is a model . \nshe is immediately helicoptered onto the vessel , and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in 80 years . \nas the memories come flooding back , she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer ( kate winslet ) , the fianc ? e of wealthy cal hockley ( billy zane ) and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater ( frances fisher ) . \non board there are rich and poor , everyone trust in the ship\'s designer ( jonathan hyde ) and her master , captain e . j . \nsmith ( bernard hill ) . \non board the ship , rose , unhappy and restless meets jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) - a young american artist , poor , brave and attractive . \na love story slowly emerges and the two lovers must not only experience the difference between the social classes , but also face the greatest power on earth - death . \ncameron could as well have called his picture "" the never ending love "" or "" love at first sight "" , as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple , and not on the disaster itself . \nthe plot is anything but original and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soap-opera . \nthe director doesn\'t even try to overcome his empty script . \nbecause of its primitive and predictable plot , titanic is totally depending on the visuals that truly are breathtaking . \nrussel carpenter\'s rich , majestic and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award-worthy . \neverything from art direction to visual and sound effects are a top notch . \nbut it doesn\'t help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them . \nthe actors are not to blame , because their characters are more like caricatures , in other words - fake . \njack is a man with many talents : he is a talented artist , handsome , brave , honest , strong , funny . . . you \nname it . \nhe doesn\'t have any dark side , he doesn\'t make any mistakes , that for a second would make him human . \njack is perfect , but he is - poor . \non the other hand we have cal . \nhe is a bastard that treats rose as an odalisque and not as his wife-to-be . \nhe lacks everything jack possesses , but he is -- rich . \nthis childish contrast between the social classes is one of those things that makes titanic nothing more than a mediocre picture . \ncameron knows precisely what we want to see . \nhis film therefore contains certain minimums to draw an audience - attractive actors , a "" tragic love story "" , beautiful visuals ( including expensive special effects ) , a dose of social criticism , a fascinating historical event ( we love true stories ) and last , but not least - an incredible media support , which proclaimed an average picture the "" greatest film of all time "" . \non the outside titanic looks perfect , but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals - is emptiness - nothing to think about . \nthe main weakness of this film , which ironically became its success , is simplicity . \ncameron enables our basic and if you wish - primitive emotions : love , hate , fear and helplessness . \neveryone understands the power of love and the threat to our beautiful couple is likewise imaginable - a sinking ship . \ntitanic is a typical hollywood production , totally and completely dependent on visual perfection to hide its primitive plot . \nit\'s a good picture , but absolutely not a masterpiece . \nit\'s among hundreds and thousands good films released every year , not better or worse than the average american film . \n'"
1,"b'the long kiss goodnight ( r ) meryl streep tried it and failed . \neven pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well-bared assets . \nhowever , geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight , a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband , renny harlin . \ndavis plays samantha caine , a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years . \nwith the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey ( samuel l . jackson ) , she slowly remembers--and reclaims--her past as charly baltimore , tough-as-nails cia operative . \nneedless to say , with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no-goodniks out to erase more than her memory . \nshane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script ; i\'m not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag , but for what it\'s worth , it delivers the goods . \nlike black\'s previous work , such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout , the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny , quirky dialogue . \nthe humor especially works well in this case , for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously . \nbut there\'s no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell : who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car . . . \nwhile ice skating ? \njackson and davis make a good team . \njackson is funny as ever as ever ; in fact , his spirited line deliveries , especially when he first appears , are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction . \nas good as he is , the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis , who shows much promise as an action heroine . \nwhat makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn\'t take herself too seriously . \nshe is obviously in on the joke , slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation . \nthis is not to say that she doesn\'t need work--sometimes she lays on the "" toughness "" a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature . \nbut should the public embrace the film and , in turn , the notion of a kick-ass female , davis could have found her special niche . \nit seems as if davis and harlin\'s first collaboration , the middling pirate epic cutthroat island , was just a dress rehearsal ( albeit a very costly one ) for long kiss , in which the wife-husband team hit their action stride . \nanyone simply looking for a fun , escapist entertainment that requires little-to-no thinking will find this film to be a more-than-welcome kiss . \n'"
1,"b""of the major horror sub-genres , vampire movies are easily the most adaptable . \nthink about it . \nfrankenstein movies haven't changed all that much because they still need that mad-scientist-in-bavarian-castle setting . \nif you made a frankenstein movie today , you'd have to have the monster be a virus or something -- and outside of michael j . fox , there aren't any actors that could play a virus convincingly . \nmovies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt . \nthere's not much you can do with werewolves except take them to london or paris , unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something . \n ( and there's that michael j . fox thing again . ) \nbut you can have vampires do anything , and you can place them in any genre you want , just about . \nyou can have traditional vampire movies ( bram stoker's dracula ) or have the anne rice version ( interview with the vampire ) , or play it for laughs ( vampire in brooklyn ) . \nyou can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california ( the lost boys ) to squalid mexican dives ( from dusk till dawn ) to your local high school ( buffy , the vampire slayer ) . \nwere it not redundant , you could have a movie about a law firm full of vampires . \nany day now , i expect we'll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play a day game in order to break the home run record . \nor , you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movie -- and when you do that , you get blade . \nwesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie -- the silent , expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path . \nin this case , the everything happens to be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead , bleeding corpses . \nsnipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in u . s . marshals , but does a demonstrably better job here as a half-vampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers . \nblade is a silent , brooding presence , laying waste to vampires without a shred of remorse . \nhe is as cold as his silver-bladed sword , as single minded as his garlic-filled bullets . \nyet , he's not without quirks : blade drives a battered muscle car and has to glean rolex watches from his vampire victims in order to stay solvent . \nlike any good hong kong movie , blade is heavy on the chopsocky action . \nfor some reason , blade spends a lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional anti-vampire weapons of garlic and silver . \n ( blade dismisses a man-portable arc lamp as being too heavy , although it looks to be a more efficient tool to dispatch vampires . ) \nunfortunately , the guiding hand of john woo is absent from this film , relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers , which it most strongly resembles . \nthe replacement killers is the last movie i saw that i didn't review -- mostly because it made no impression on me , and i couldn't remember anything other than noise , violence , and the intensity of fat's performance . \nblade has a little more going for it , and has the vampire myth to draw from -- but other than that , it's the same kind of movie -- exciting , with well choreographed action scenes , but with no resonance . \nwith a stronger villain ( stephen dorff is ( pardon the pun ) curiously bloodless as the head vampire , leaving us to wonder what denis leary might have done with the role ) , a wittier script , and a strong supporting cast , blade might have been able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer entertainment . \nas it is , blade is an average action movie that serves to do nothing but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber and the vampire movies just keep multiplying . \n"""

1,"b'not since oliver stone\'s natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility . \nwhile fincher\'s films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997\'s the game ) into something like a definitive statement . \njack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia . \non the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer . \nhere he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia . \nstrangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob\'s breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy "" tourist "" named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity . \nlater , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life . \none night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don\'t ask-- you\'ll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn\'t feel good . \nit is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison . \nhe moves into tyler\'s squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are "" don\'t talk about fight club .

1,"b'while watching "" shallow grave , "" i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens\' "" blood simple . "" \nboth are good films in which several characters , none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil , indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes . \nthe body count rises , and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands . \nboth films are also flawed , but for different reasons . \n "" blood simple "" is unrelentingly dark and moody , but its characterizations were a little hollow . \n "" shallow grave , "" on the other hand , is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes , and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they\'d accomplished for a more standard , audience-pleasing ending . \nthe events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time , yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end . \nas the film begins , we are introduced to alex ( ewan mcgregor ) , juliet ( kerry fox ) , and david ( christopher eccleston ) , a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow . \nthey are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious , but other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch . \na man named hugo moves into the apartment\'s remaining vacancy , and the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose . \njuliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash ( presumably from criminal activities ) . \nthe three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death ; after a drawing of straws , the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david , who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning . \nall of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film , and part of what makes "" shallow grave "" so brilliant for a while is that i honestly had no idea what was coming next . \nother than the obvious question of why they don\'t report the death and simply hide the cash , which is not addressed , the plotting and characterization , while sometimes predictable , worked in a way that kept my attention and , on more than one occasion , gave me chills . \ni will , therefore , attempt to continue this review in a way that doesn\'t give away too much of the plot . \nbroadly , the trio are in danger due to hugo\'s underworld connections , as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process . \na police inspector ( ken stott ) is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment , asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with a junior detective . \ndavid , meanwhile , becomes increasingly paranoid , moves into the attic , and develops an affinity for sharp objects . \ndirector danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment , and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other . \nwhile i do not consider myself the "" happy endings are automatically stupid "" type , i thought that "" shallow grave "" really should have ended in tragedy - a realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison , in the mental hospital , or in the morgue . \nthis could have been accomplished , quite credibly , but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch and opt for a more conventional "" caper "" ending in which we get a kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom , and nothing more . \ngranted , this isn\'t really a "" happy "" ending , but it\'s still pretty light-hearted compared to what preceded it . \ni really shouldn\'t say anything more about the ending as far as details go , but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable . \nyes , this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes , but ultimately it left me feeling as if i\'d been cheated . \nstill , "" shallow grave "" was brilliant most of the way through , and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller , and i am therefore awarding it three stars . \ni guess i just can\'t help but think about that fourth star that boyle and hodge let slip away . \n'"
0,"b'michael robbins\' hardball is quite the cinematic achievement . \nin about two hours , we get a glancing examination of ghetto life , a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy , speeches about never giving up , a cache of cute kids ( including a fat one with asthma ) , a hard-luck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic "" big game , "" where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined . \nall that\'s needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich ? s . \ni can\'t wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd . \nobviously , hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball . \nit stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler , who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam . \nout of solutions , he begs his successful corporate friend ( the always welcome mike mcglone ) to lend him $5 , 000 . \ninstead , mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend . \nreeves , who wants to keep his fingers , accepts the offer , but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely . \nthe drowsy-voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs . \nand maybe , just maybe , they\'ll play in the big championship game . \none of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins ( summer catch ) , adapted from daniel coyle\'s non-fiction book , is that there aren\'t any . \nthe movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombie . \nthat wouldn\'t be so bad , if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them . \nmost of the kids\' time is spent yelling at each other , talking in slang and acting surprised . \nthere\'s little that\'s naturally amusing about them , as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling . \nthe worst of the lot is a tough-talking younger player ( dewayne warren ) whose sole purpose , as the movie unfolds , is being an emotional pawn , a tactic so utterly despicable i can\'t find the right words to express myself . \nthe adults also don\'t fare well . \nreeves is impressively uninspiring as the down-on-his-luck loser . \nthe character is poorly written , but reeves gives another charisma-free performance . \nevery time he speaks , he sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up . \nkids are supposed to rally around this guy ? \ndiane lane , who co-stars as reeves\' obligatory love interest , remains a glowing screen presence ( see my dog skip for better proof ) . \nit\'s too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like , "" these kids trust you , and they don\'t trust anyone !

1,"b'many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come , the new film by visionary director vincent ward . \nmost will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors . \nbut little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell . \nwalking out of the theater , i could see the audience\'s disgust . . . \none member even had to be awakened after the film ended . \ndon\'t believe the previews that you see . . . \nthis is definitely not a film for everyone . \nthis is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in recent years . \nkids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline . \nthe plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us . \nit goes back and forth in time , as if it has no boundaries . \nthink of the film city of angels . \nnow add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision . \nboth films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office . \ncosting around $85 million to make , the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it\'s money back . \nbut due to it\'s story , i doubt it will . \nfor everyone who thought titanic\'s story was too simple and cliche , here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay , it may not have done nearly as well . \nbut don\'t get me wrong . . . \ni hope the film does do well . \nit\'s a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen . \ni doubt most of us could have thought of this place , even in our own mind . \nwhat dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals . \nthe only film that surpasses it is dark city . \nfull of rich , shocking colors , we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to . \nbut don\'t do that , because you\'ll end up going to hell . \nwhat dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake . \nchris "" christy "" nielsen ( robin williams ) is startled by the sudden jolt , but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat . \nannie ( annabella sciorra ) spies chris , as well , and both eventually bond and get married . \nannie is an artist , whose paintings are colorful , lush , and surrealistic . \nchris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself . \nthey also have two children , marie ( jessica brooks ) and ian ( josh paddock ) . \nbut one day , the two children are killed in a car crash , and it almost destroys annie . \nshe tries to commit suicide , but fails , and is then put in an institution . \nchris copes with the problem by realizing they aren\'t around anymore , and nothing will change that . \njust as annie gets her life back in order , chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim . \nchris goes to heaven , or his version of heaven , rather . \nguided by albert ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy . \nthat is , until he realizes how miserable he is without annie . \nprior to heaven , he would try to comfort annie , but the more he was around , the more pain she felt . \nchris decides to leave her alone . \nlittle does he realize what will happen next . \ni\'m not about to say , because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story ( many critics , however , give it away ) . \ncertainly , chris dying is crucial to the plot , but they tell you that he dies in the previews . \nstory is not necessarily important for this movie to work , because it deals with the afterlife . \nhowever , strangely , virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil . \na couple of comments here and there , but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life . \n "" we\'re soul mates !

"" \n- adam west in the 1966 batman feature film , casually kicking at a pathetic-looking rubber shark attached to his leg \ni had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness , but in many instances batman and robin nears , and at some point even exceeds this standard . \nthis is a disasterously bad film , easily the worst in the series to date , and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive - it\'s loud , garish , and obnoxious , with pointless , gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill . \nbatman and robin features the caped crusaders ( george clooney debuting as batman , with chris o\'donnell returing as robin ) squaring off against another bevy of chemically-induced villains - the nefarious ice-cold mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) , armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights , and the slinky poison ivy ( uma thurman ) , who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her ( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result , but whatever ) , and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss . \nby ivy\'s side is the giant steroid monster bane ( jeep swanson ) , a grunting hulk of a beast . \nthe villains\' goals are noble ones - freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit ( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees ) , so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife ( vendela ) , dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation , and ivy\'s intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth , albeit by destroying all human life . \nmeanwhile , on the homefront , life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth ( michael gough ) , and the arrival of his niece barbara ( alicia silverstone ) . \nakiva goldsman\'s screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad , with astonishingly terrible dialogue , lame jokes , and an awful by-the-number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement . \nit makes goldsman\'s screenplay of batman forever , which i thought was dreadful , look positively inspired in comparison . \ni am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i\'d seen used in - no joke - an episode of gilligan\'s island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production . \njoel schumacher\'s direction of batman and robin is horrific , with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance . \nthere is a clear conceit towards neon in this film , even moreso than with his previous batman forever , with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo ( just in case , i suppose , if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin ) , and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly-pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy\'s chosen new abode . \nanother action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late-night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons . \nmr . schumacher\'s focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible , to the detriment of the story - there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all-out camp and heartfelt drama , with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective . \nit is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film\'s opening , even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered . \nis batman and robin supposed to be campy ? \ni think it is - it\'s hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously . \n ( one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted "" bomb ! "" \neach time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory . ) \nis it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be ? \ni somehow doubt it - the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn\'t attempting to be the utter farce which it is . \narnold schwarzenegger is top-billed in the film as the villainous mr . freeze , and is bland and uninteresting , perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be . \nmr . schwarzenegger\'s attempts to be menacing are laughable , and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable ; frankly , everything he does onscreen is laughable . \nby the end of the film , i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen . \nthe bulk of his performance consists of uttering near-unintelligble puns and one-liners featuring every possible permutation of "" cool ! "" \nin the least inventive way . \ngeorge clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin , being overshadowed by the villains , and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film . \nhis batman is hardly an imposing figure . \nchris o\'donnell is unimpressive in a one-note performance , while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all . \nthe film\'s one saving grace ? \nundoubtably uma thurman\'s entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy . \nher work in batman and robin is certainly over-the-top , but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film . \nms . thurman\'s comic timing is impeccable , and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully . \n ( i\'m already starting to positively reassess jim carrey\'s performance in batman forever . ) \nher amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film , and when she\'s offscreen the film greatly suffers . \ni figure that if one has to die , being kissed to death by uma thurman isn\'t a half-bad way to go . \nwhile batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse-pounding excitement , i must admit that i was not bored watching it , although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening - my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one-liner , and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat . \nit\'s been a long time since i\'ve laughed so much at a movie . \n "" at "" , of course , is the operative word . \n'"

1,"b'cinematically speaking , gordon parks\' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film . \na bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman\'s "" black private dick that\'s a sex machine to all the chicks "" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking . \nyet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , "" blaxploitation , "" died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness . \nthe reason for this is the same one that explains the film\'s connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft . \nwhile the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass . \nthis fact also explains why john singleton\'s y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is . \nmuch like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_\'s plot doesn\'t score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers . \ncontrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff . \nthe star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972\'s _shaft\'s_big_score ! _ and 1973\'s _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city . \nhowever , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors . \nwhen a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i . \nbut that\'s easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime . \npeoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson\'s way toward commanding this film . \npeoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages . \nhowever , he isn\'t so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples\' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) . \nit\'s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that\'s exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless . \nthen again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson\'s impressive star turn doesn\'t quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars . \nbale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on . \ncollette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane . \nbusta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft\'s sidekick rasaan . \nregistering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno . \n ( jackson also has little to "" do "" in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn\'t even have one sex scene . ) \nthat singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he\'s not really an action director . \nthis is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases . \nthey move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it\'s just that there\'s nothing terribly inventive about them . \nthese set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they\'re unsurprising and conventional . \nbut if there\'s anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it\'s make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive . \nfrom the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes\' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado . \neven a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary . \nstyle doesn\'t exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that\'s of little consequence . \nwhat matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth . \n'"

1,"b'since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . \nnow , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow . \nthis realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993\'s schindler\'s list shows . \nmost of today\'s mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience . \nthat\'s why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol\' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema . \nthe movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950\'s company town of coalwood , west virginia . \nit\'s a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine . \nthe mine , which is run by homer\'s father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however . \nafter watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , "" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . "" \ndrafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets . \nwith the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things . \noctober sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston . \njohnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he\'s doing here . \nhe molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust . \nhe does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film\'s charm . \nhis finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer\'s mother and father . \nthe cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles . \nlaura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need . \nher role is instantly likeable . \nchris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer\'s father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie . \nhe\'s definitely a driving force in homer\'s life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable . \nthe script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys\' endeavors in a lighthearted manner . \nthere are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist . \nit highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps . \noctober sky should be a success with audiences . \nalthough it doesn\'t have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she\'s all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards . \nit\'s a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see . \n'"

1,"b""it's no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office . \na poorly-written script can be bested by a superb acting corps , and a well-written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs . \nin directing his latest action-comedy , director brett ratner ( money talks ) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get-out buddy cop movie . \nin addition , rush hour serves as a first-class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude - a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types . \nthe two lead names share equal screen time here , mostly because they spend it together . \njackie chan , in his first completely american production , makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts . \nthe other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago , knock off , stands no chance against the content of this one . \nchan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise , and there's no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldn't believe their eyes the first time . \nchris tucker , on the opposite side , relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan's performance . \nhe works perfectly with the script , and it's quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines . \nalmost essential to the action genre , the plot is nonexistent . \nwe're quickly introduced to detective james carter ( tucker ) is a maverick officer for the lapd . \ncut forward to another scene where the daughter ( julia hsu ) of the american chinese consul ( tzi ma ) is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters . \nthe fbi is quick to the rescue , but the consul insists that one of his men , detective inspector lee ( chan ) , be brought on the case to help . \nthe fbi resists , but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective . \nit's here that carter and lee hook up , and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up . \nrattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up , but it doesn't quite reach the top tier of action-comedies like last year's grosse pointe blank . \nthere are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to , and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan , this might be a major drawback . \nalso , some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride , and others are there simply to look menacing . \nhowever , none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background . \nalmost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another - whether it's tucker's toned-down routine or chan's tight rein on his action sequences - and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types . \na recommendable visit to the theater , indeed . \n"""

1,"b'bruce willis and sixth sense director m . night shyamalan re-team to tell the story of david dunne ( willis ) , a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child . \non a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job , dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of . \nto make things even stranger , dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed . \na comic book art dealer named elijah price ( samuel l . jackson ) , who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly , has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life . \nprice felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him . . . \nsomeone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break . \nprice contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child . \ndunne doesn\'t believe him at first , but price assists him in discovering his "" powers "" and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is . \nwriter/director m . night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense . \nhow exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years ? \nfor shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners . \ndoes this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ? \nthe answer to that question is not a very easy one , either . \nas far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable . \nit wasn\'t until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached . \nfor unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before . \nthe story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan\'s direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving . \nthere are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis\' character and another train passenger . \nthe shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak . \nalso very impressive is the film\'s score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan\'s sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year\'s dinosaur ) . \nseveral of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film . \none of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to "" exercise "" his powers . \nthe music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie . \nif there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year , this one would be it . \nthe film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment . \nwillis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can\'t seem to figure out why he\'s been depressed for the last few years . \nhis character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him , but he eventually grows into his own under elijah\'s tutelage . \njackson is one of the better actors of our time , and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah . \nthough his hairstyle is absurd , jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked . \nrobin wright penn\'s role seems slightly underwritten , but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character\'s need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again . \nspencer treat clark , as the dunne\'s young son jeremy , shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors , and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film . \nout of all the characters , jeremy\'s is perhaps the most emotional , and clark does a great job with the role . \nwhere the film does lose points though , is during its "" surprise "" ending . \nshyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense , but i found myself saying "" that was it ? ! "" \nwhen unbreakable revealed its own ending . \nit\'s not that the ending is bad , it\'s just that the ending doesn\'t quite have the emotional punch that the other film\'s did . \nplus , it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels ( and i won\'t reveal the ending here , but you\'ll understand what i mean when you see it ) . \nessentially , what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable . \nthe only real problem is that the ending doesn\'t quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor . \nas long as it isn\'t held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) , it should be a remarkably well liked film . \none thing seems clear , though . \nshyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film . \n'"
1,"b""review- peter jackson's the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie , and still coming in at the extremely cheap $30 million price tag . \nbut for those who were dismayed by this year's blockbusters like twister and independence day , the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects . \nand for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily . \nthe frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a high-profile movie can get . \nmichael j . fox stars as frank bannister , a con artist who can speak to ghosts . \nhe uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people , then he comes and pretends to get rid of them . \nthis is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago . \nfrank's latest customers are a young couple , played by trini alvarado and peter dobson . \nwhen dobson ends up dead , alvarado starts to take an interest in fox . \nbut dobson's spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he's dead . \nthis leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado , with dobson tagging along as a ghost . \nthings start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town . \nfox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims , but noone else can see that . \nso when fox shows up to try and save each victim , naturally people suspect he is the killer . \nfox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector's hit list , and the last half hour of the movie deals with fox's attempts to save her from this evil spirit . \nthere are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh . \nthe movie starts off as a black comedy , and ends up a horror-action film . \nthe mix between these genres are perfect . \nno laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror , and vice versa . \none point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman . \nbut that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form . \nmichael j . fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wife's death , and then is forced to confront this later on . \nalvarado , looking like andie macdowell , makes a great frightened , tough , and smart heroine . \nand jeffery combs , as a paranoid fbi agent , is brilliantly bizaare . \nthe frighteners never once feels like it is running long . \nthe first hour is as funny as any comedy this year , and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters . \nthis movie is probably what casper would've looked like if david lynch directed it . \nit's easily the best film of the year , so far . \n"""
